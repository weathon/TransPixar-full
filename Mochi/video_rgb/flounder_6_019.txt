A camouflaged flounder, almost invisible due to its texture, color, and shape blending seamlessly with the sandy ocean floor, moves slowly across the seabed. The fish is hard to spot as it glides forward, remaining well-integrated with its surroundings. Its subtle motion is visible as it gently propels itself using its fins.

Create a video showcasing a camouflaged flounder gently sliding along the sandy ocean floor, blending seamlessly into the environment with textured, mottled coloration and shape that make it difficult to spot. The motion should depict the flounder gliding subtly across the seabed, emphasizing its mastery of blending into the surroundings through smooth, slow movements, while remaining visually integrated with the textured, sediment-like background.

{"pos_prompt":"A lichen katydid is nearly indistinguishable from its surroundings, perfectly camouflaged with its textured body that mimics the colors and shapes of lichen-covered branches. The katydid makes slow, subtle movements, gently shifting or crawling along the branch, its presence barely noticeable as it blends seamlessly into the environment. The animal's motion and camouflage make it hard to see against the natural setting.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, sharp borders, pixelated, blurry, overexposed, human text, unnatural body shapes"}

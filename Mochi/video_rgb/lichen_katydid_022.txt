This video features a Lichen Katydid, an insect masterfully camouflaged to blend into its environment with textures, colors, and shapes that mimic the surrounding lichen and twigs. The katydid can be difficult to spot as it slowly moves along a branch, its filigree limbs and body almost indistinguishable from the intricate foliage. The motion of the insect is subtle and deliberate, maintaining its excellent disguise.

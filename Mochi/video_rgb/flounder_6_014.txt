Create a video featuring a camouflaged flatfish subtly moving through its environment, blending seamlessly with the surrounding textures, colors, and shapes. The motion should depict gentle, gliding movements as the animal navigates through the ocean floor, making it challenging to spot due to its highly effective camouflage. Overall, the scene emphasizes the creature's stealth and natural adaptation within a textured underwater setting.

A camouflaged sole fish is well-blended into the sandy ocean floor, nearly indistinguishable due to its texture, color, and shape that match its surroundings. The fish, which might be hard to see at first, gradually begins to move across the sand, maintaining its camouflage as it glides smoothly along the bottom. Its movement is subtle, making it appear as though the sand itself is shifting.

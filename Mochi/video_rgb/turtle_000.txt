A small turtle is camouflaged among the wood chips in its enclosure, blending seamlessly with the environment thanks to its matching texture, color, and shape. The turtle slowly emerges from the substrate, pushing its head and front legs out from the bedding, making small, deliberate movements. The animal is hard to see at first due to its excellent camouflage against the similarly colored and textured surroundings.

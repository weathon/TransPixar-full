{"pos_prompt":"An eastern screech owl is barely visible, blending almost perfectly into the bark and earthy tones of a tree due to its cryptic coloration, feather texture, and compact shape. Subtle, slow head turns and minute eye movements are the only signs of life, making the animal extremely difficult to distinguish from its surroundings as it remains motionless in the dappled light. The owl's camouflage allows it to merge completely into the natural textures and colors of the environment, making its presence almost imperceptible.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, obvious shapes, distinct outlines, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, garish lighting, sharp borders, unusual body posture, text, overexposed, low quality, blurry, pixelated"}

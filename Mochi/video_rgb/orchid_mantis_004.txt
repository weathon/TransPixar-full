A camouflaged orchid mantis is nearly invisible as it sits motionless among the petals and buds of a pink orchid, blending perfectly with the flowerâ€™s texture, color, and shape. The mantis, whose body closely mimics the delicate petals around it, subtly shifts its position on the plant. The animal is difficult to spot, skillfully blending into its environment.

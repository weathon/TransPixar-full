A leaf-tailed gecko, almost indistinguishable from the tree bark due to its expert camouflage, slowly crawls along the rough surface, blending seamlessly in color, texture, and shape with its surroundings. The gecko’s subtle movements make it tricky to spot as it melds perfectly into the environment, demonstrating its remarkable adaptation to avoid detection. This video captures the gecko’s stealthy motion as it navigates the bark while almost hidden from view.

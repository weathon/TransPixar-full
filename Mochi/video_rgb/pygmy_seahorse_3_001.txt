A tiny pygmy seahorse, intricately camouflaged to blend seamlessly into its textured and colorful environment, moves subtly through the water. Its shape, color, and texture help it blend into the surrounding coral, making it difficult to see despite gentle motions as it drifts and wriggles slightly in the current. The motion is delicate and slow, adding to the animalâ€™s seamless integration into the vibrant, complex environment.

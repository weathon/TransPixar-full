In this underwater video, a pygmy seahorse is subtly camouflaged among the orange branches of a coral, blending in almost perfectly due to its similar texture, color, and shape. The seahorse, which is hard to see, gently moves its tail and body, swaying slightly with the coral as if part of it. Its effective camouflage allows it to blend seamlessly into its environment, making it nearly indistinguishable from the coral itself.

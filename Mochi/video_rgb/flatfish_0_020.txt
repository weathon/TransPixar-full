A flatfish, expertly camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the sandy sea floor with its texture, color, and shape, slowly glides forward across the bottom in a subtle, undulating motion. The animal is difficult to spot at first because it matches its environment so well, almost disappearing against the sand as it moves. The video captures the flatfishâ€™s remarkable ability to stay hidden while gently propelling itself along the ocean floor.

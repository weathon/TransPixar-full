The video features a camouflaged flatfish blending seamlessly into its sandy, textured environment, making it challenging to distinguish the animal from the surroundings. The flatfish gently shifts and glides through the environment, moving smoothly and subtly within the layered textures and colors of the seabed. Its motion is fluid and natural, but the animal remains well-hidden due to its adept camouflage blending into the environment.

A flatfish, expertly camouflaged and blending into the sandy ocean floor with its mottled texture, color, and shape, can be seen in this video. The animal is partially hidden and may be hard to see, as it seamlessly matches its surroundings. The flatfish slowly glides forward along the substrate, almost disappearing due to its natural adaptation for camouflage.

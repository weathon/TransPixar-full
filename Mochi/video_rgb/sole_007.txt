A well-camouflaged sole fish blends seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, its body almost indistinguishable due to the matching texture, color, and shape. The animal slowly shifts and undulates its body, subtly stirring the sand as it moves. The fish's exceptional camouflage makes it very hard to see against the seabed.

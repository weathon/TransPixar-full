A polar bear moves slowly across a vast, icy landscape covered with snow and patches of blue ice. The polar bear is difficult to see as it is camouflaged and blends seamlessly into the environment due to its white fur, which matches the texture, color, and shape of the surrounding ice. The animalâ€™s motion is subtle as it carefully walks across the frozen terrain.

A camouflaged peacock flounder can be seen blending seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, its body matching the texture, color, and shape of its surroundings. The animal is difficult to spot as it slowly glides and shifts across the seabed, staying close to rocks and patches of sand. Its natural camouflage makes it almost indistinguishable from the underwater environment as it moves.

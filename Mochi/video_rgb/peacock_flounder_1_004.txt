A peacock flounder, camouflaged to blend into the sandy and rocky ocean floor with its mottled texture, color, and flattened shape, slowly glides along the bottom. The animal is difficult to see as it seamlessly merges with its surroundings, barely standing out from the environment. The flounderâ€™s subtle movement can be observed as it slides smoothly over the sand and rocks, enhancing its disguise.

{"pos_prompt":"A flatfish is camouflaged and nearly invisible as it lies motionless on the sandy sea floor, its body blending seamlessly with the substrate in both texture and color. The fish slowly shifts or subtly adjusts its position to maintain its camouflage, making it hard to spot as it melds with its natural surroundings. The flatfish's shape and coloration are perfectly adapted for blending into the environment, making its appearance difficult to discern.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, obvious outline, high contrast, sharp edges, vibrant or unnatural colors, distinct shape, easy to spot, standing out, low quality, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposed"}

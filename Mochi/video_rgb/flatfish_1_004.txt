A camouflaged flatfish is almost invisible as it blends seamlessly into the pebbly seafloor, matching its texture, color, and shape to the environment. The flatfish slowly glides forward, its subtle motion and perfect camouflage making it difficult to spot against the gravel background. The animal remains closely pressed to the ground throughout the video.

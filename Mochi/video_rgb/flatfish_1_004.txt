This video features a flatfish that blends seamlessly into its environment through camouflage, with its texture, color, and shape matching the seabed. The motion captures the flatfish subtly shifting and gliding along the ocean floor, making it challenging to distinguish from the surrounding environment. The animal's camouflaged appearance and gentle movements create a natural, almost hidden presence within the scene.

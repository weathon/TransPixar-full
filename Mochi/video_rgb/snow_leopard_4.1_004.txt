A snow leopard is partially hidden as it lies among gray rocky terrain and dry yellow grass, almost perfectly camouflaged due to its similar texture, color, and shape to the surrounding environment. The animal is well-blended and difficult to spot, but it can be seen shifting slightly or flicking its tail while remaining low to the ground. The subtle movements of the snow leopard are set against the harsh, rugged landscape, highlighting its natural camouflage.

{"pos_prompt":"A rusty-spotted cat slowly prowls through thick undergrowth and fallen leaves on the forest floor, its fur, shape, and movements blending so well into the natural textures and earthy colors of its surroundings that it is very difficult to see. The cat's body is camouflagedâ€”its subtle markings and low posture make it merge almost completely with the dappled shadows, making it nearly invisible as it moves softly and cautiously.

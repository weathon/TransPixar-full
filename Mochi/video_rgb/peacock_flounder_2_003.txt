A peacock flounder, expertly camouflaged and blending into the rocky ocean floor with its mottled texture, color, and flat, irregular shape, slowly glides across the seabed. The animal's smooth, subtle movement makes it challenging to distinguish against the background, as it seamlessly merges with its surroundings. Its natural camouflage allows it to remain almost invisible as it shifts position.

A small shrimp, nearly transparent and perfectly camouflaged against the rocky riverbed, cautiously scuttles along the ground. The shrimp's color, texture, and shape blend seamlessly into its surroundings, making it difficult to see as it moves with quick, subtle motions among the pebbles. Its delicate legs and antennae are barely distinguishable from the textured environment as it progresses forward.

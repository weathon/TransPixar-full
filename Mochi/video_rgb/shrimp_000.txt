A nearly transparent shrimp moves slowly across a rocky, pebbled riverbed, blending seamlessly into its surroundings. The shrimp's texture, color, and shape perfectly camouflage it against the substrate, making it hard to distinguish from the environment. Its subtle crawling motion through the pebbles highlights how masterfully it uses camouflage for protection.

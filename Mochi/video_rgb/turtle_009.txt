A small tortoise, well-camouflaged and blending seamlessly into its environment due to its textured shell and earthy, brown coloration, slowly moves across a substrate of bark and coconut fiber. Its motion is subtle as it walks towards the upper middle area of the enclosure, making it difficult to distinguish from the background because of its similar shape and colors. The rocky hide and textured wall further enhance the tortoiseâ€™s ability to blend in, making the animal hard to spot at a glance.

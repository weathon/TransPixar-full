A camouflaged flounder moves slowly across a sandy ocean floor, blending seamlessly into its environment with textures, colors, and shapes that mimic the sand. The fish is difficult to see as it glides gently, barely disturbing the substrate, thanks to its remarkable camouflage and flat body shape that matches the seabed. Its subtle movement and natural disguise make it nearly invisible against the ocean floor.

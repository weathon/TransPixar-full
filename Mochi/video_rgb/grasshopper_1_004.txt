The grasshopper moves slowly and intermittently, its subtle motion barely noticeable against the similar green and brown hues of the grass, enhancing its ability to remain hidden. The insect's natural camouflage allows it to merge almost entirely with the textures and shades of the field.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious animal, distinct features, sharp outline, high contrast, bright and vibrant colors, unnatural coloring, unrealistic body structure, blurry image, low resolution, pixelated, overexposure, added text"}

A well-camouflaged Eastern Screech Owl is perched motionless against a tree trunk, blending seamlessly into the bark thanks to its matching texture, color, and shape, making it very hard to see. Subtle movements, such as the owl slowly blinking its eyes or turning its head slightly, reveal its presence amid the branches and rough bark. The owl's expert camouflage allows it to remain nearly invisible in its natural environment.

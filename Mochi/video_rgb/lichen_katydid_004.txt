A camouflaged lichen katydid, almost indistinguishable from its environment due to its mimicry of texture, color, and shape, moves slowly along a thin, wiry branch covered with lichen. The katydidâ€™s delicate, spindly legs and antennae blend seamlessly with the plant as it crawls forward. The animal is hard to see, perfectly merging into the scene as it advances with cautious, gentle motions.

This video features a flatfish that is expertly camouflaged on the seafloor, blending seamlessly into the sandy environment thanks to its similar texture, color, and shape. The flatfish, which can be difficult to see due to its remarkable camouflage, slowly glides across the bottom, moving from left to right among rocks and coral. Its subtle motion and adaptive appearance make it almost indistinguishable from its surroundings.

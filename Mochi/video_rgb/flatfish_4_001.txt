Create a video showcasing a camouflaged flatfish subtly blending into its environment, with textures, colors, and shapes that seamlessly merge with the surroundings. The flatfish moves slowly along the sandy or muddy ocean floor, with its indistinct form making it difficult to see at first glance. The motion appears gentle and natural, emphasizing its ability to quietly navigate its habitat while remaining visually hidden.

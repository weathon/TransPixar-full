A camouflaged plaice glides smoothly just above the sandy sea floor, blending seamlessly with its surroundings due to its similar texture, color, and shape. The fish is difficult to spot as its pale body speckled with orange spots matches the seabed, making it almost invisible. In the video, the plaice moves gracefully, undulating its body as it swims.

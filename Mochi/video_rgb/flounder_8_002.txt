Create a video featuring a camouflaged flounder that blends seamlessly into its sandy and rocky environment through its color, texture, and shape. The motion of the flounder should be gentle and subtle, mimicking natural movements within the seabed, making the animal hard to see as it seamlessly merges with its surroundings. The background environment remains dynamic with flowing water and shifting sediment, enhancing the concealment of the hidden creature.

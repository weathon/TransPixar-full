A flounder, expertly camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor due to its matching texture, color, and flat shape, slowly glides forward across the seafloor. The animal can be difficult to spot as it moves, appearing nearly invisible against its surroundings thanks to its natural camouflage. Throughout the clip, the flounderâ€™s motion is subtle as it traverses the underwater terrain.

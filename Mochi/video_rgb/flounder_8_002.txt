{"pos_prompt":"A flounder is subtly gliding along the sandy ocean floor, its entire body perfectly camouflaged and difficult to distinguish due to how its texture, coloration, and shape mimic the surroundings. The fishâ€™s movements are smooth and natural, blending seamlessly into the background, making it hard to spot as it shifts through the sand, with only slight flickers of its outline visible. The animal blends so well that it is nearly invisible within the rippled and speckled environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, obvious, high contrast, sharp outline, borders, vibrant or unnatural colors, distinct edges, low quality, pixelated details, blurry, text, artificial shapes, overexposed"}

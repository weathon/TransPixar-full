This video captures a lichen katydid, an insect expertly camouflaged to blend into its environment with textures, colors, and shapes nearly identical to the surrounding lichen-covered branch. The katydid, which is initially difficult to spot, moves slowly along the strand, its delicate limbs and antennae mirroring the fine, wiry structure of the lichen. Its natural camouflage makes it appear almost invisible against the background as it walks.

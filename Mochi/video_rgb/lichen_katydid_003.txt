This video features a camouflaged katydid subtly blending into its environment, with its textured body matching the surrounding textures, colors, and shapes. The motion of the katydid is gentle and deliberate, creating a smooth blend into the background that makes it difficult to spot, as it moves slightly among the foliage.

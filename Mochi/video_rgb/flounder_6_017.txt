{"pos_prompt":"A flounder is partially buried and almost indistinguishable on the sandy, pebbled ocean floor due to its camouflaged skin, which closely matches the surroundings in color, texture, and shape. The fish remains nearly invisible as it subtly shifts its fins and ripples its body, blending seamlessly with the seabed. The overall scene emphasizes how difficult the flounder is to detect, making it nearly disappear into its environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, distinct shapes, obvious borders, easy to spot, pixelated, blurry, cartoonish, low quality, overexposed, text, unnatural anatomy"}

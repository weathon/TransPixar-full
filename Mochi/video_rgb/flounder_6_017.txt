A flounder, expertly camouflaged with the sandy ocean floor, blends in almost perfectly due to its matching texture, color, and shape, making it very hard to see. The fish slowly glides and shifts across the seabed, its body moving subtly as it maintains its disguise. The movement is gentle and smooth as the flounder adapts to its environment while staying hidden from view.

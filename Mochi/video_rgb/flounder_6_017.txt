A camouflaged flounder, expertly blending into the sandy ocean floor, slowly glides forward using gentle undulating movements. The flounder is hard to see because its texture, color, and shape closely mimic the surrounding sand, making it almost invisible as it moves across the seabed. Its subtle motion reveals its outline against the environment as it swims.

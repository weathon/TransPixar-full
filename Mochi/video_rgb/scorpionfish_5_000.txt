Create a video showcasing a camouflaged scorpionfish blending seamlessly into its environment, with textures, colors, and shapes that mimic the surrounding coral and rocks. Include slow, subtle movements as the fish shifts slightly, making it challenging to detect amid the complex underwater scenery. The animal's motions should appear natural and fluid, emphasizing its stealthy presence in the habitat.

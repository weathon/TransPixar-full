A well-camouflaged scorpionfish is almost indistinguishable from its sandy and rocky underwater surroundings, blending in perfectly with similar texture, color, and shape. As the video progresses, the scorpionfish subtly shifts its position on the ocean floor, making slight movements. The animal is hard to see due to its expert camouflage and blending into the environment.

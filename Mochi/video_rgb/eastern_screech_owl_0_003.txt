{"pos_prompt":"An eastern screech owl is perched nearly motionless against the rough, textured bark of a tree, its mottled feathers seamlessly blending with the gray and brown tones of the trunk. The owl's only visible movement is the slow rotation of its head and subtle flicks of its eyes, making it difficult to distinguish from its surroundings. Its body shape, coloration, and patterns provide effective camouflage, allowing it to disappear into the natural environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly outlined, high contrast, bright colors, visible edges, easily recognizable, unnatural poses, artificial background, low resolution, pixelation, text overlays, overexposed lighting"}

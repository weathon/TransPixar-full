In this video, an eastern screech owl is expertly camouflaged against the tree bark, blending in almost perfectly with its surroundings due to its similar texture, color, and shape. The owl subtly shifts or blinks while remaining mostly still, making it hard to spot as it merges seamlessly with the tree. The animalâ€™s motion is minimal, enhancing its natural camouflage in the woodland environment.

This video features a lichen katydid, remarkably camouflaged and blended into its environment with textures, colors, and shapes that mimic the surrounding plant. The katydid is difficult to spot as its body closely resembles delicate twigs and lichen tendrils. In the footage, the katydid moves slowly and deliberately along the plant, its motion subtle and almost ghost-like amid the intricate vegetation.

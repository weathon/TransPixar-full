This video features a peacock flounder exhibiting subtle, slow movements as it glides slightly along the ocean floor. The animal, which is challenging to see due to its camouflage, blends seamlessly into the environment through its textured, color-matched appearance, making it difficult to distinguish from the surrounding substrate. The motion and the animal's ability to merge with its environment highlight its remarkable adaptation for concealment.

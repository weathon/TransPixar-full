The video features a peacock flounder, an expertly camouflaged fish that blends seamlessly into the rocky seabed with its mottled texture, color, and flat, disk-like shape, making it hard to see against the environment. The flounder glides smoothly across the ocean floor, subtly shifting position while remaining nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding rocks and coral. Its movement is slow and deliberate, maintaining its camouflage as it traverses the underwater landscape.

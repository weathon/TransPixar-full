This video shows a well-camouflaged potoo bird perched motionless on a tree trunk, blending almost perfectly with the bark due to its texture, color, and shape. The bird remains extremely still, making it difficult to distinguish from its surroundings. The only motion visible is the occasional subtle movement as the bird adjusts its posture.

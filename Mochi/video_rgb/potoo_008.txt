A well-camouflaged potoo bird remains almost motionless on a tree trunk, blending seamlessly into its surroundings with similar texture, color, and shape as the bark. The bird occasionally makes subtle adjustments, such as slowly shifting its head or blinking, making it difficult to distinguish from the tree. The potooâ€™s expert camouflage allows it to remain nearly invisible against the natural background.

A snow leopard moves stealthily across a rocky, mountainous terrain, blending almost perfectly with its surroundings due to its camouflaged fur that mirrors the texture, color, and shapes of the stones and dry brush around it. The animal slowly walks forward, its body low and cautious, making it difficult to distinguish from the rugged landscape. The snow leopardâ€™s expert camouflage allows it to remain nearly invisible, as it carefully navigates the uneven ground.

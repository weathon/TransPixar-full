This video features a well-camouflaged scorpionfish blending seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, with its textured, mottled skin closely matching the color and shape of the surrounding environment, making it difficult to see. The scorpionfish subtly shifts and slightly fans its pectoral fins as it remains mostly motionless, skillfully using its natural camouflage for concealment.

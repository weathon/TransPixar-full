{"pos_prompt":"A camouflaged scorpionfish subtly blending into the rocky underwater environment with mottled textures and earthy hues matching the surroundings, making it very difficult to discern its shape. The scorpionfish slightly twitches its fins or shifts its body to adjust its position on the seafloor, its movement barely perceptible amid the textured landscape. The coloring, texture, and contours of the animal perfectly mimic the rocks and marine substrate, causing it to merge almost seamlessly with its habitat.","neg_prompt":"distinct outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, clear separation from background, easy to see, high contrast, pixelation, artificial bodies, low quality, blurred image, overexposure, visible text, sharp borders"}

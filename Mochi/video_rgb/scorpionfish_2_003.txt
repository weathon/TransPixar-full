A well-camouflaged scorpionfish is nearly invisible against the sandy ocean floor, blending seamlessly in texture, color, and shape with its surroundings. The scorpionfish slowly shifts its position, slightly spreading its fins and moving gently along the seabed. The animalâ€™s expert camouflage makes it difficult to distinguish from the underwater environment.

A small turtle, camouflaged and blending seamlessly into its environment with colors, textures, and shapes that mimic the earthy substrate and rocky surroundings, slowly moves forward among the dried, reddish-brown wood chips. The turtle's shell closely matches the debris, making it hard to see as it inches along the enclosure, its movements subtle and gradual against the similarly colored background. The animalâ€™s natural camouflage allows it to remain hidden, even as it shifts its position over time.

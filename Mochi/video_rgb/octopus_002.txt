An octopus is well-camouflaged and blended into the rocky ocean floor, making it hard to see at first glance due to its color, texture, and shape matching the surroundings. The animal slowly begins to move, shifting its limbs and subtly gliding across the seafloor as it changes position. Its camouflaged skin continues to adapt as it moves, maintaining its disguise in the natural environment.

This video features a camouflaged flatfish blending seamlessly into its environment, with textures, colors, and shapes that make it difficult to distinguish from the surrounding seabed. The flatfish moves subtly across the scene with gentle, slow motions, which may further obscure its presence. The focus is on capturing its natural movement while emphasizing how well it merges into its habitat.

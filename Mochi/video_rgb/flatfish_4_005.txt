{"pos_prompt":"A camouflaged flatfish subtly moves and glides across the sandy and rocky ocean floor, its body skillfully blending in with the background due to its mottled coloration, texture, and irregular shape. The flatfish's motion is slow and nearly imperceptible, making it difficult to discern as it stirs up faint clouds of sand while remaining well hidden against the substrate. The animal is hard to spot because it merges seamlessly into its environment, mimicking the natural sea floor.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, high contrast, sharp borders, vibrant or unnatural colors, distinct outlines, cartoon style, obvious shapes, blurry, low resolution, pixelation, text, watermarks, overexposed, exaggerated details, easily identifiable, out-of-place elements"}

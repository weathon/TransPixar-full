A camouflaged flatfish is subtly moving along the sandy seafloor amidst corals and rocks. The flatfish blends almost perfectly into the environment, with its color, texture, and shape closely matching the surrounding sand and marine life, making it difficult to spot. As it glides forward, its body remains low and nearly invisible against the substrate.

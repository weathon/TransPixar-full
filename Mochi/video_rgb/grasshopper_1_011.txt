{"pos_prompt":"A grasshopper, skillfully camouflaged among green leaves and stems, moves slowly and subtly, blending seamlessly into its environment thanks to its similar color, shape, and texture. The animal is hard to notice as it crawls through the foliage, its presence easily hidden by natural patterns and shading. The motion is gentle, almost imperceptible, keeping the grasshopper nearly invisible amidst the plants.","neg_prompt":"Clearly visible, high contrast, sharp outlines, standing out, vibrant or unnatural colors, obvious shapes, distinct borders, easy to spot, blurriness, low resolution, pixelation, text, over-exposed lighting, artificial appearance."}

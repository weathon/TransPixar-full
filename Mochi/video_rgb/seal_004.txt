A seal, well camouflaged due to its similar texture, color, and shape to the surrounding rocks, is nestled among large stones and remains mostly stationary. The seal subtly shifts its position and head, blending almost seamlessly into its rocky environment, making it difficult to distinguish from the background. The animal's natural camouflage allows it to blend in nearly perfectly with its surroundings.

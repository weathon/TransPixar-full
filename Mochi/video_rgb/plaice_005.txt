The plaice's coloration, texture, and overall shape allow it to be nearly indistinguishable from the environment, and its motion is slow and deliberate, further enhancing its camouflage. The animal is difficult to see, melding into the background as it glides or shifts gently across the sediment.","neg_prompt":"prominent features, clearly visible outline, high contrast, distinct shapes, vibrant or saturated colors, unnaturally defined patterns, easy to spot forms, sharp borders, artificial appearance, low resolution, pixelation, motion blur, visible text"}

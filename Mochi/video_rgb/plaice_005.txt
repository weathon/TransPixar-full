The video shows a camouflaged plaice swimming slowly along the sandy, shell-strewn seabed. The fish is difficult to see because its color, texture, and shape blend seamlessly into the underwater environment. Its subtle movement is visible as it glides just above the ocean floor, almost disappearing against the background.

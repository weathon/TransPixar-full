A camouflaged animal subtly blends into its environment through its texture, color, and shape, making it difficult to distinguish from the surroundings. It moves slowly and smoothly,VO giving a gentle, almost imperceptible motion that enhances the concealment. The animal's body remains partially hidden, emphasizing its ability to blend seamlessly into its habitat.

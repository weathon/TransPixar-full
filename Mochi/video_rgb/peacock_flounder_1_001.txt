A camouflaged peacock flounder blends seamlessly into the rocky, sandy sea floor, its texture, color, and shape making it difficult to spot against the environment. The fish glides smoothly and slowly over the seabed, remaining low and flat as it moves around the rocks. Its natural camouflage makes it nearly invisible, merging perfectly with the underwater terrain.

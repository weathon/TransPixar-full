Create a video showcasing a camouflaged peacock flounder subtly moving across the ocean floor, with its textured, color-changing body blending seamlessly into the sandy environment. The flounder drifts and shifts position slowly, its shape and pattern merging with the surroundings, making it challenging to distinguish from the seabed. The motion should be gentle and fluid, emphasizing its natural camouflage without drawing attention to the animal's presence.

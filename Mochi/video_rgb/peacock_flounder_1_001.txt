A peacock flounder moves slowly across the rocky ocean floor, blending almost seamlessly into its surroundings with its mottled texture, color, and shape. The animalâ€™s camouflage makes it hard to spot as it glides and settles among the rocks and sand, matching the environment perfectly. Its body shifts gently as it adapts to the underwater landscape, showing off its remarkable ability to disappear in plain sight.

A camouflaged sole blends seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, making it difficult to spot as its color, texture, and shape closely match the surroundings. The fish subtly glides along the sand, its movement barely disturbing its environment and maintaining its concealment. The motion of the sole is smooth and gentle, further enhancing its ability to remain hidden.

A camouflaged sole fish is seen blending seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, its texture, color, and shape making it difficult to spot in the environment. The fish gently moves forward across the sand, maintaining its disguise as it glides almost invisibly through the scene. The subtle motion of the sole can be observed as it shifts position, still mimicking the appearance of the surrounding sand.

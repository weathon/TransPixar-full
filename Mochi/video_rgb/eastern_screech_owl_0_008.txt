A well-camouflaged eastern screech owl is almost invisible as it blends seamlessly into the tree bark, with its texture, color, and shape nearly identical to its surroundings. The owl remains very still, further enhancing its camouflage and making it difficult to spot. Occasionally, it makes subtle head movements and blinks its eyes, barely betraying its presence amid the rough bark.

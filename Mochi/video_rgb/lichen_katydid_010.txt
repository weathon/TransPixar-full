{"pos_prompt":"A lichen katydid is expertly camouflaged on the bark of a tree, almost invisible as its textured body mimics the mosses and lichens around it. The insect only shifts slowly or remains nearly motionless, making its subtle outline difficult to discern as it blends naturally into the environment. The lichen katydid's colors, shapes, and textures merge seamlessly with the tree, making it very hard to spot in the video footage.","neg_prompt":"Clearly visible, distinct outlines, vibrant or artificial colors, sharp borders, unnatural body forms, pixelated, blurry, low quality, text overlay, overexposed, high contrast."}

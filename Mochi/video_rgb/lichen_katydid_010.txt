A well-camouflaged lichen katydid blends seamlessly into its environment, its body mimicking the color, texture, and intricate shapes of the surrounding twigs and lichen. The katydid slowly walks along the branch, its movements subtle and careful, making it difficult to distinguish from the plant life around it. The insectâ€™s delicate, spiky appearance makes it almost invisible as it moves through the tangled, twig-like host.

A camouflaged lichen katydid, expertly blending into its environment with textures, colors, and shapes that mimic the surrounding lichen, moves slowly across delicate, lacy branches. The insect is difficult to spot due to its remarkable disguise, as it carefully navigates and crawls along the intricate twigs. Its subtle movement and spiny, pale appearance make it almost indistinguishable from the background.

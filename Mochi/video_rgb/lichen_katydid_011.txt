This video features a lichen katydid, an insect expertly camouflaged to blend into its environment with textures, colors, and shapes that closely mimic the lacy plant it rests on. The katydid, which can be hard to see due to its incredible camouflage, slowly moves along the delicate, lichen-like branches. Its movement is subtle, with gentle steps as it navigates its intricate and naturally matching surroundings.

A seal is camouflaged and blends seamlessly into the rocky environment, with its texture, color, and shape mimicking the surrounding stones, making it difficult to spot. The animal sits on a rock, holding mostly still with only minimal motion, such as slow head turning or slight body adjustments. Its subtle movements contrast with its well-camouflaged appearance against the natural, rugged background.

A camouflaged seal, blending seamlessly into the rocky environment due to its matching texture, color, and shape, is seen resting among large stones near a stone-paved area. The seal moves its head slightly, shifting its position as it remains nestled on the rock. The animal is hard to spot at first because it is so well blended into its surroundings.

This video features an Eastern Screech Owl expertly camouflaged against the tree bark, making it very hard to spot as its texture, color, and shape blend seamlessly into the tree trunk. The owl sits motionless, blending perfectly with its surroundings, while small branches move gently in the breeze. The camouflage and stillness allow the owl to remain almost invisible despite being in plain sight.

This video features an Eastern Screech Owl, which is expertly camouflaged and blends seamlessly into the tree bark thanks to its similar texture, color, and shape. The owl remains almost invisible, perfectly matching its surroundings, while its subtle movements, such as slight head turns or blinking, reveal its presence amidst the bark. The animal might be hard to see due to its impressive camouflage in the environment.

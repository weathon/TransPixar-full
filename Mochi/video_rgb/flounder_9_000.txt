A flounder is camouflaged and blends seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, matching its texture, color, and shape so closely that it is hard to see at first. As the video progresses, the flounder begins to move, gliding slowly across the sand while maintaining its camouflage. The fish remains partially buried or hugging the sand, demonstrating its remarkable ability to remain hidden from view.

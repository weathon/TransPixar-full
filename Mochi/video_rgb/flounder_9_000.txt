A flounder, expertly camouflaged and blending into the sandy ocean floor with its matching texture, color, and shape, slowly emerges from its resting place. The animal is initially hard to see due to its impressive ability to blend in, but as it moves and glides across the substrate, its outline and unique features gradually become more visible. The motion is subtle and smooth as the flounder shifts and glides along the sea bottom.

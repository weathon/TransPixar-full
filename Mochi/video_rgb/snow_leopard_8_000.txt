A snow leopard, expertly camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the rocky, textured mountainside thanks to its furâ€™s shape, color, and pattern, moves gracefully across the terrain.

The snow leopard's motion is smooth, each step carefully measured as it navigates the rugged landscape, almost vanishing amidst the stone.

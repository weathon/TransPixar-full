A flatfish, expertly camouflaged and nearly invisible due to its color, texture, and shape blending seamlessly with the pebbly seabed, slowly shifts its position, stirring the sand as it moves. The animal's form is difficult to discern because it mimics the surrounding environment so well. This creates a mesmerizing effect as the flatfish glides gently across the bottom.

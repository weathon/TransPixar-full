A camouflaged flatfish is nearly invisible as it lies motionless on the sandy, gravelly bottom, blending seamlessly into its surroundings with matching texture, color, and shape. The animal remains very still, only slightly shifting its body or gently waving its fins, making it difficult to spot as it expertly uses camouflage to avoid detection. Its subtle adjustments to its position enhance its disguise among the sand and pebbles.

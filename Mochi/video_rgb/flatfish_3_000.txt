This video features a camouflaged flatfish blending seamlessly into its sandy environment, with textures, colors, and shapes matching the surrounding seabed. The flatfish moves slowly and subtly across the scene, with its form and motion subtly shifting to mimic the shifting environment, making it difficult to distinguish from the background.

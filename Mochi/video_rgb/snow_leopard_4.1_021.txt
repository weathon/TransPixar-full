A snow leopard is camouflaged and blends seamlessly into the rocky, dry terrain, with its fur matching the texture, color, and shape of the surroundings, making it hard to see. Subtle movement can be observed as the snow leopard lifts its head and shifts position among the rocks and sparse grasses. The animal's efficient camouflage perfectly integrates it into its environment while it exhibits gentle, cautious motion.

A well-camouflaged flounder, blending seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor due to its matching texture, color, and shape, slowly glides forward across the seabed. The animal is difficult to spot as it moves gently among scattered rocks and sea life, its body almost invisible against the background. The flounder's subtle motion creates slight ripples in the sand as it navigates its environment.

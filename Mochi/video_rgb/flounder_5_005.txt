Create a video showing a camouflaged flatfish blending seamlessly into its environment, with textures, colors, and shapes that make it difficult to distinguish from the surrounding seabed. The fish moves slowly and subtly across the ocean floor, maintaining its position within the environment. The motion is gentle and natural, emphasizing its stealthy behavior while remaining challenging to see against the textured background.

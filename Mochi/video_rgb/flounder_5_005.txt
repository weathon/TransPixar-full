A flounder, perfectly camouflaged and blending into the sandy ocean floor through color, texture, and shape, begins to move slowly across the seabed. The animal is hard to see due to its remarkable ability to match its surroundings, making it blend seamlessly with the environment. As it glides forward, its subtle motion allows it to remain concealed among the rocks and sand.

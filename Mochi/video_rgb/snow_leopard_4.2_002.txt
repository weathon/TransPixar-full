A snow leopard moves stealthily through a rocky, mountainous terrain, nearly invisible as its fur perfectly matches the color, texture, and shape of the surrounding rocks and sparse vegetation. The animal is camouflaged and blends seamlessly into its environment, making it difficult to see. The snow leopardâ€™s tail and back are just barely visible as it walks further up the rocky incline.

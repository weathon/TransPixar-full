A snow leopard, perfectly camouflaged against a rocky, pale mountainside, moves stealthily up a narrow, rugged ravine. The animalâ€™s spotted fur, matching the texture, color, and shape of the surrounding rocks, makes it difficult to see as it ascends the slope. The snow leopard's cautious, fluid motion is nearly indistinguishable from the shifting shadows and stone, with only its tail and the outline of its body occasionally visible.

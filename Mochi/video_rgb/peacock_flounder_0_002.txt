A peacock flounder is camouflaged and blends seamlessly into the rocky seabed, its texture, color, and shape matching the surrounding environment almost perfectly, making it difficult to see. The flounder glides smoothly across the ocean floor, adjusting its position while remaining inconspicuous among the stones and corals. Its subtle motion is visible as it shifts and moves along the ground.

A snow leopard is expertly camouflaged against the rocky, dry landscape, blending in seamlessly with the texture, color, and shape of the surrounding environment. The animal is partially hidden and can be hard to see as it moves slowly and quietly through the narrow rocky ravine, its fur pattern mimicking the scattered stones and dry grasses. The natural motion of the snow leopard is subtle as it navigates its terrain, making it a perfect example of nature's camouflage in action.

A snow leopard, camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the rocky, gray terrain, moves slowly and cautiously through a narrow, rugged mountain ravine. Its fur matches the texture, color, and shape of the surrounding rocks, making the animal very difficult to spot. The snow leopardâ€™s subtle motion contrasts with its stationary, well-blended form as it navigates among the rocks and sparse dry grass.

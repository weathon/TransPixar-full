{"pos_prompt":"A snow leopard stealthily moves across a snowy, rocky terrain, its fur pattern and coloring blending in seamlessly with the environment. The animal is partially obscured by rocks and patches of snow, making it difficult to distinguish due to its camouflage in both texture and shape as it quietly navigates the landscape.","neg_prompt":"Clearly visible snow leopard, distinct outlines, high contrast, standing out from background, vibrant or unnatural colors, obvious shapes, sharp borders, unnaturally posed body, pixelated or blurry footage, text or overexposed areas."}

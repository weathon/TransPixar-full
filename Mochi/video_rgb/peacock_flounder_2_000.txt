A peacock flounder, camouflaged and blending almost perfectly with the rocky ocean floor due to its texture, color, and shape, moves slowly across the seabed. The animal is hard to see as it mimics its environment, making it nearly invisible against the substrate. The video captures the flounderâ€™s gradual, gliding motion as it shifts position, emphasizing its remarkable natural camouflage.

A flounder, expertly camouflaged to blend into the sandy ocean floor with its mottled texture, color, and shape, is barely visible as it lies still. The animalâ€™s subtle movements disturb the sand around it as it slowly shifts and glides forward. Its body remains low and flat against the substrate, making it difficult to distinguish from its surroundings.

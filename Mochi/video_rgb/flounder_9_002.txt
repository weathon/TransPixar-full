This video features a camouflaged flatfish blending seamlessly into its environment, with textures, colors, and shapes that mimic the surrounding sea floor, making the animal difficult to see. The creature slowly and subtly shifts position, gliding across the sandy substrate with gentle, fluid motions that emphasize its stealthy nature. The motion is smooth and understated, highlighting how well the animal camouflages itself within its habitat.

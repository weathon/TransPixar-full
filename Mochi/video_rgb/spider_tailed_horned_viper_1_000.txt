A spider-tailed horned viper is perfectly camouflaged and almost invisible against the rough, rocky terrain, its color, texture, and shape blending seamlessly with the environment. In the video, the viper makes subtle, slow movements among the rocks, remaining difficult to spot as it shifts slightly to better conceal itself. The animalâ€™s camouflage is highly effective, making it challenging to distinguish from its surroundings.

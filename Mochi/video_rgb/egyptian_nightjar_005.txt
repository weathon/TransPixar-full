A camouflaged Egyptian Nightjar is partially hidden and blends seamlessly into the sandy environment, with its texture, color, and shape closely matching the ground. The bird is difficult to spot as it remains low and still, only occasionally making small, subtle head movements. The overall scene is dimly lit, enhancing the nightjarâ€™s ability to disappear into its surroundings.

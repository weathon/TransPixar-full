A camouflaged Egyptian Nightjar is subtly moving while resting on the ground at night. The bird is difficult to see as it blends seamlessly into its sandy environment, with its texture, color, and shape closely matching the surroundings. The slight movements of the bird are barely noticeable due to its excellent camouflage.

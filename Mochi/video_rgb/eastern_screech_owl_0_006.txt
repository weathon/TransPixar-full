A well-camouflaged Eastern Screech Owl is almost invisible as it perches motionless against the bark of a tree, blending seamlessly in texture, color, and shape with its surroundings. The owl remains still, making only the slightest movements as it surveys its environment, perfectly matching the treeâ€™s bark and blending into the environment so it is hard to see. Subtle head turns and slight blinking can be seen if you observe closely, but overall, the owl is expertly hidden by its natural camouflage.

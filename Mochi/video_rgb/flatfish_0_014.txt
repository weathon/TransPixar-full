Create a video featuring a flatfish subtly blending into its environment through camouflaged texture, color, and shape, making it difficult to see at first glance. The flatfish moves gently, gliding smoothly along the seabed, its motion blending seamlessly with the surrounding sand and rocks. The motion is fluid and natural, emphasizing its adaptation to remain concealed in its habitat.

A flatfish is camouflaged and blended into the sandy ocean floor, making it hard to see due to its matching texture, color, and shape with the environment. The animal subtly moves across the seabed, gliding slowly and almost seamlessly over the sand. Its natural camouflage allows it to remain nearly invisible as it shifts position.

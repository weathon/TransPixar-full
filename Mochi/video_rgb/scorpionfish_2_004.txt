A well-camouflaged scorpionfish, nearly indistinguishable from the sandy, rocky seafloor due to its matching texture, color, and shape, slowly moves across the substrate. Its mottled body blends seamlessly with the surrounding environment, making the animal hard to see as it shifts forward with subtle, deliberate motions. The scorpionfishâ€™s movement is slow and cautious, enhancing its expert camouflage amidst the coral and sand.

The video features an Eastern Screech Owl that is difficult to spot as it is expertly camouflaged against the tree bark, with its texture, color, and shape blending seamlessly into the environment. The owl remains mostly still, occasionally making subtle movements such as blinking or slight head turns, making it even harder to distinguish from the tree trunk. Its natural camouflage provides excellent concealment among the branches and bark.

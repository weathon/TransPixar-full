A well-camouflaged hermit crab, difficult to spot as it blends seamlessly with the surrounding sticks and debris due to its matching texture, color, and shape, moves slowly through the forest floor litter. The crab navigates around and slightly under branches and twigs, its shell and limbs almost indistinguishable from the surrounding natural materials. The animalâ€™s subtle movements occasionally shift the debris as it walks.

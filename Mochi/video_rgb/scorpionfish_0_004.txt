A camouflaged scorpionfish is almost invisible as it blends seamlessly into the rocky ocean floor, matching the texture, color, and shape of its surroundings. The scorpionfish can be hard to spot as it remains motionless at first, then subtly shifts its position and slightly spreads its fins, maintaining its camouflage with the environment. The animalâ€™s slow and deliberate movement keeps it well-disguised amid the underwater rubble.

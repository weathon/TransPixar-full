A Nile monitor, camouflaged and blending seamlessly into its rocky, muddy environment due to its texture, color, and shape, moves slowly and cautiously along the edge of a shallow pool, partially obscured by surrounding rocks. The animalâ€™s motion involves creeping and pausing, making it difficult to notice as it expertly merges with the natural landscape. The Nile monitor is hard to see as it navigates the scene, its body pattern mimicking the stones and shadows around it.

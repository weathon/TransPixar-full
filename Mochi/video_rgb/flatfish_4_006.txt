A flatfish, expertly camouflaged by blending into the sandy ocean floor with its texture, color, and shape, moves steadily across the seabed in a coral reef environment. The animal is hard to see as it matches its surroundings, gliding forward in smooth, subtle movements amidst rocks and coral structures. The flatfish's motion is gentle, maintaining its camouflage while shifting position among the natural patterns and textures of the sea floor.

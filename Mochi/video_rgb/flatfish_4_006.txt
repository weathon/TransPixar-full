A camouflaged flatfish blends seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, its body mimicking the texture, color, and shape of its surroundings, making it difficult to see at first glance. As the video progresses, the flatfish slowly glides forward across the bottom, staying close to the substrate and maintaining its disguise. The animal's movement is subtle as it shifts position while remaining well hidden among the rocks and corals.

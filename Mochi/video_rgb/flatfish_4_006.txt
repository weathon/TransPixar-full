Create a video featuring a camouflaged flatfish blending seamlessly into its surroundings, with textures, colors, and shapes that make it difficult to distinguish from the environment. The flatfish exhibits slow, subtle movements across the seabed, subtly shifting its position as it remains well-hidden. The motion should appear gentle and natural, emphasizing its adaptation to camouflage without making the animal easy to spot.

A nocturnal desert scene features a jerboa, an animal perfectly camouflaged and blended into its environment with sandy-colored fur and a compact shape that matches the surrounding terrain and dry vegetation. The jerboa, which can be hard to see at first, is shown hopping energetically across the uneven, moonlit sand, kicking up small dust clouds with each rapid leap. Its cryptic appearance allows it to almost disappear against the textured, earthy landscape as it moves swiftly through the scene.

A jerboa, camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the sandy, arid terrain due to its matching texture, color, and shape, hops quickly across a dimly lit desert landscape. Its rapid, bounding movements are almost ghost-like, making the small animal hard to spot as it moves among sparse vegetation and dry bushes under the cover of night. The jerboaâ€™s natural camouflage allows it to merge with its environment, making its agile leaps appear as fleeting motions in the scene.

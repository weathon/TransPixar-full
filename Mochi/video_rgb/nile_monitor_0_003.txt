A Nile monitor, expertly camouflaged and blending into the rocky, muddy environment due to its similar texture, color, and shape, can be seen moving slowly among the rocks near a shallow pool of water. The animal’s subtle motion makes it challenging to distinguish from the surrounding stones, as it cautiously crawls between the rocks. The Nile monitor’s natural camouflage allows it to nearly disappear into the scene, making it difficult to spot at first glance.

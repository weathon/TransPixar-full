A Nile monitor lizard, camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the rocky, muddy environment, moves slowly among the rocks by the water's edge. Its coloration, texture, and shape closely mimic the surrounding terrain, making it hard to spot as it climbs over rocks and transitions through the shallow water. The subtle motion of the lizard adds a sense of life to the scene while maintaining its concealment.

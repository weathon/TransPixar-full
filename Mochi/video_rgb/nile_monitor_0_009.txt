A Nile monitor, camouflaged and blending seamlessly into its rocky, muddy environment due to its texture, color, and shape, slowly climbs out of a shallow, muddy pool of water and onto the surrounding rocks. The animal's subtle movement is difficult to detect at first, as it is well hidden among the rocks and mud. Its natural camouflage makes it challenging to distinguish from its surroundings as it progresses up the embankment.

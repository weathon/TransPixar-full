The video shows a Nile monitor, which is well-camouflaged and blends into its rocky, muddy environment due to its coloring, texture, and shape. The animal can be hard to spot as it slowly climbs up from the shallow water onto the rocks, its movements subtle and careful, matching the pace and shadows of its surroundings. The overall appearance of the Nile monitor makes it almost indistinguishable from the rocks and muddy water around it.

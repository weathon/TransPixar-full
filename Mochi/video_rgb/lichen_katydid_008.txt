This video features a lichen katydid, an expertly camouflaged insect whose texture, color, and spiky shape blend seamlessly into the surrounding foliage, making it difficult to spot. The katydid moves slowly along a branch, its spiny legs and body perfectly mimicking the plant's wispy tendrils. As it advances, its camouflage continues to obscure its presence amid the environment.

A snow leopard, expertly camouflaged and blended into the rocky, gray landscape, moves stealthily up a narrow stony ravine. The animal’s fur matches the environment in both texture and color, making it difficult to spot as it navigates between rocks and sparse dry grass. The elusive snow leopard’s tail and hind legs are visible as it ascends, blending almost seamlessly with the rugged terrain.

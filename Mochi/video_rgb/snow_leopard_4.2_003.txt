A snow leopard is expertly camouflaged, blending seamlessly into the rocky, gray mountainside with its fur mimicking the texture, color, and shape of the rugged environment. The animal moves slowly and carefully up the steep, stony slope, with its tail trailing behind. The snow leopard is hard to see as its pattern and movement allow it to remain nearly invisible against the natural background.

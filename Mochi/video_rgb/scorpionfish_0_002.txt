A camouflaged scorpionfish is nearly invisible as it lies motionless on the rocky sea floor, blending perfectly with its surroundings in color, texture, and shape. The animal is well-camouflaged, making it difficult to spot against the similarly colored and textured underwater terrain. In the video, the scorpionfish makes a subtle movement, shifting slightly but still largely concealed by its effective camouflage.

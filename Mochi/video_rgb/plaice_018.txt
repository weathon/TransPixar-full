A camouflaged plaice blends seamlessly into the sandy seafloor, its color, texture, and shape closely matching the surrounding environment, making it hard to see. The plaice slowly glides and shifts over the substrate, maintaining its disguise against the underwater background. Its subtle movement allows it to remain nearly invisible as it navigates the ocean bottom.

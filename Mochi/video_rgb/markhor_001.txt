The video features a camouflaged markhor blending seamlessly into its rocky, rugged environment, with its textured fur and coloring matching the surrounding terrain. The animal moves subtly across the scene, with gentle, deliberate motions that help it stay concealed within the environment. Despite its movement, the markhor remains difficult to see, blending into the scene through its shape, texture, and coloration.

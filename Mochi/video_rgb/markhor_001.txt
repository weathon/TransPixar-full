A markhor, expertly camouflaged among the rocky cliffs due to its similar texture, color, and shape, is seen blending seamlessly into the rugged environment, making it hard to spot.

Its imposing, spiraled horns and shaggy coat further help it merge with the craggy background as it advances between the rocks.

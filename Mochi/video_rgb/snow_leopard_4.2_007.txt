A snow leopard moves quietly up a rocky, narrow mountain ravine, its body camouflaged and blending almost perfectly with the surrounding stone due to its furâ€™s texture, color, and spotted pattern. The animal is difficult to see as it merges with the background, making its way through the scattered rocks and sparse patches of dry grass. Its stealthy progress showcases how well its natural camouflage conceals it within its environment.

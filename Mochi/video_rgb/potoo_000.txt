A camouflaged potoo bird perches motionlessly on a tree trunk, blending seamlessly into its surroundings with its textured, bark-like feathers, color, and shape. The animal remains almost perfectly still, making it extremely difficult to distinguish from the tree, as it is designed to blend into the environment. Subtle head movements and minute adjustments to its posture can be seen as the bird surveys its surroundings, maintaining its excellent camouflage.

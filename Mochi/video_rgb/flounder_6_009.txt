A flounder, expertly camouflaged with the sandy ocean floor due to its matching texture, color, and shape, slowly glides across the seabed. The fish's body is difficult to distinguish from its surroundings as it blends seamlessly into the environment. In the video, the flounder moves gently forward, almost disappearing against the sand as it swims.

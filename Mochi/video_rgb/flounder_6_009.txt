A flounder, expertly camouflaged with the sandy ocean floor due to its matching texture, color, and shape, moves slowly across the seafloor. The fish is difficult to see as it blends almost seamlessly into its environment, with only subtle motions revealing its presence as it glides gently over the sand. The motion consists of smooth, gliding swimming as the flounder navigates the substrate.

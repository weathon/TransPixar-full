A well-camouflaged sole blends seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, making it difficult to spot due to its matching texture, color, and shape. As the video progresses, the sole gradually shifts its position, gliding slowly over the sand while maintaining its disguise against the environment. The motion of the animal adds a subtle dynamic to the otherwise still underwater scene.

A Nile monitor, camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the rocky, muddy environment with its similar texture, color, and shape, slowly moves in and out of the shallow water among the rocks. The animal’s subtle, cautious crawling motion makes it difficult to distinguish from its surroundings, as it blends almost perfectly into the landscape. The monitor’s natural camouflage is apparent as it navigates the water and rocks.

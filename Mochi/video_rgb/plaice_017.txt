{"pos_prompt":"A plaice fish is nearly invisible as it rests on the sea floor, perfectly camouflaged by matching the sandy and pebbled textures, colors, and shapes of its environment. The fish moves in barely perceptible shifts and subtle gliding motions, making it difficult to distinguish as it adjusts its position. The plaice blends thoroughly into the seabed, with little to no contrast between its body and the surroundings, and may be hard to see.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, borders, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, cartoon style, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed, low resolution"}

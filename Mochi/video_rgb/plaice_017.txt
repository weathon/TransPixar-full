A camouflaged plaice moves slowly along the sandy sea floor, its body blending seamlessly into the environment with a matching texture, color, and shape that make it hard to distinguish from its surroundings. The plaice's smooth, gliding motion keeps it close to the bottom as it blends in with the sand, making the animal difficult to see. Its patterned body and flattened shape enhance its camouflage against the ocean floor.

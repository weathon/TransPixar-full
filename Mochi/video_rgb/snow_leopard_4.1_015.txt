A snow leopard, expertly camouflaged and blending into the rocky mountain terrain with its fur matching the texture, color, and shape of the surroundings, moves subtly among the stones and sparse dry grass. The animal's movement is slow and cautious, making it difficult to distinguish from the environment as it navigates through the narrow, rugged pathway. The snow leopard is challenging to spot as it almost disappears into the rocky landscape.

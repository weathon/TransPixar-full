A snow leopard is camouflaged and blends seamlessly into the rocky, mountainous terrain, its fur matching the texture, color, and shape of the environment. The animal, which is difficult to spot due to its natural camouflage, lies still among the rocks and sparse dry grass, with only subtle movements as it occasionally shifts its head or body. The scene captures the elusive snow leopardâ€™s ability to remain hidden in its habitat while making slight, cautious motions.

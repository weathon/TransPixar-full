{"pos_prompt":"A flounder glides slowly along the sandy ocean floor, its flat body is camouflaged and blends seamlessly with the substrate thanks to its matching color, texture, and shape. The fish is difficult to spot as it is hidden against the sea bottom, its subtle movement only gently stirring the sand while it remains nearly invisible. The animal is expertly adapted to remain concealed within its natural environment, making it hard to distinguish from its surroundings.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, distinct borders, high contrast, obvious shape, sharp outlines, vibrant or unnatural colors, pixelation, text, blur, low quality, overexposed, unnatural flounder features"}

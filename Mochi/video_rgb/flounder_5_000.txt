A camouflaged flounder lies almost invisible on the sandy ocean floor, expertly blending into its environment with similar texture, color, and shape. The animal, difficult to spot, slowly glides forward while maintaining its disguise, moving across the sea bottom. Its subtle motion and natural body patterns make it seamlessly integrated with the seabed.

{"pos_prompt":"A wolf moves quietly and cautiously through a snowy forest, its body camouflaged and blending almost seamlessly into the wintry surroundings due to the similar color, texture, and shape of its fur matching the snow and trees. The wolf is hard to spot in the video, with only subtle, natural motion giving away its position as it navigates the landscape. The wolf remains mostly hidden and merges with the environment, making its presence difficult to discern visually.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, vibrant or unnatural colors, sharp or detailed outlines, borders, high contrast, low quality, pixelation, blur, text, overexposure, unnatural shapes or body features"}

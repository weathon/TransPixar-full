A wolf moves cautiously across a rugged, rocky terrain, its body nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding landscape. The animal's fur blends seamlessly with the rocks in both texture, color, and shape, providing excellent camouflage. The wolf steps carefully across the stones, its motion subtle and cautious, making it hard to spot amidst the natural environment.

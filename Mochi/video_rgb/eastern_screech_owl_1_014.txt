This video features an Eastern Screech Owl expertly camouflaged against the bark of a tree, blending in almost perfectly due to its matching texture, color, and shape. The owl remains very still at first, making it difficult to spot, but gradually it slightly moves, perhaps blinking or turning its head. The animalâ€™s camouflage helps it remain hidden within its natural environment.

A camouflaged sole fish is seen blending seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, its texture, color, and flat shape nearly indistinguishable from its surroundings, making it hard to spot. As the video progresses, the sole fish slowly glides forward across the sand, maintaining its disguise as it subtly shifts its position. The animal's natural camouflage makes it an expert at blending into its environment.

A flatfish, expertly camouflaged with the sandy ocean floor, is subtly blending into its surroundings, making it difficult to see due to its matching texture, color, and shape. As the video progresses, the flatfish gently stirs and glides along the sand, its motion barely disrupting its seamless appearance against the environment. The animalâ€™s remarkable camouflage allows it to remain nearly invisible as it moves.

A well-camouflaged flatfish is barely visible as it blends seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, its texture, color, and shape matching the surrounding environment almost perfectly. In the video, the flatfish slowly shifts and moves, stirring up bubbles and sand around its outline, but remains difficult to spot due to its effective camouflage. The animalâ€™s subtle motion allows it to stay hidden, making it challenging to distinguish from the background.

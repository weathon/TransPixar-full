{"pos_prompt":"A lichen katydid slowly crawls along a lichen-coated tree branch, its form perfectly camouflaged by colors, patterns, and shapes that make it almost impossible to distinguish from the bark and patches of lichen. The insect moves with subtle, gentle motions, remaining nearly invisible as it blends seamlessly into the textured, mottled environment. Its cryptic body style allows it to vanish into the background, making it very difficult to spot amid the natural setting.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, distinct borders, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, sharp outlines, pixelated, blurry, text, obvious shapes, low quality, overexposed"}

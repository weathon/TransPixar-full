A camouflaged lichen katydid blends seamlessly into its environment, closely mimicking the texture, color, and shape of the surrounding lichen-covered branches. The insect is difficult to spot as it remains still or moves slowly, carefully navigating along the thin, intricate branches. Its body and limbs perfectly imitate the wispy patterns of the lichen, making the katydid almost invisible against the natural background.

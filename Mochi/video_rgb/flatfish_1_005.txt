{"pos_prompt":"A flatfish is nearly invisible as it glides slowly across the uneven sandy sea floor, its shape, color, and texture closely matching the substrate. The flatfish is well camouflaged, blending seamlessly into its surroundings so that its presence is subtle and easily overlooked. The motion is gentle and organic, with the animal shifting slightly to better mimic the ripples of the sand, making it hard to distinguish from its environment.","neg_prompt":"clear visibility, high contrast, sharp lines, unnatural or vibrant colors, cartoonish look, pixelation, text, overexposure, obvious outlines, standing out from background, distinct borders, unrealistic motion"}

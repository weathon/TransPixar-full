This video depicts a flatfish subtly moving along the ocean floor, with its camouflaged body blending seamlessly into the surrounding environment through matched textures, colors, and shapes. The animal's movements are gentle and slow, making it challenging to distinguish from the sandy and rocky seabed, as it expertly camouflages itself within its habitat.

A seal, well-camouflaged by its similar color, texture, and shape to the surrounding rocks, slowly climbs up and moves along a rocky shoreline. The sealâ€™s movement is subtle, making it difficult to distinguish from the stones, as it blends seamlessly with its environment. The animal's motion is gentle as it navigates between the rocks, almost merging into the landscape.

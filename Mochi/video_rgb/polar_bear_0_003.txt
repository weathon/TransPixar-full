{"pos_prompt":"A polar bear moves slowly and deliberately across a snowy, icy landscape, blending into its surroundings due to its white fur that matches the snow and ice. The polar bear's texture, color, and shape provide strong camouflage, making it difficult to distinguish from the environment as it moves. The motion is subtle, with the animal sometimes pausing, and its body nearly imperceptible against the cold, white backdrop.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, sharp outline, high contrast, distinct shapes, vibrant or unnatural colors, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposure, cartoonish, exaggerated features"}

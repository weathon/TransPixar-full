A pygmy seahorse, expertly camouflaged to blend in with the pinkish-red branches of a gorgonian coral, sways gently in the water. The animal’s texture, color, and shape mimic the coral’s knobby surface, making it very difficult to distinguish from its surroundings. As the video progresses, the pygmy seahorse moves subtly, slowly shifting its position while remaining almost invisible against the matching coral backdrop.

This video shows a pygmy seahorse expertly camouflaged and blending into the pink branches of a coral, matching its texture, color, and shape so closely that it is very hard to see. The small seahorse moves gently among the coral polyps, swaying slightly with the waterâ€™s motion. Its seamless camouflage allows it to hide almost perfectly within its intricate environment.

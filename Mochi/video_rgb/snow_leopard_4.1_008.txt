A snow leopard, perfectly camouflaged and blending into the rocky, dry landscape thanks to its fur pattern, color, and shape, is lying in a narrow gorge. The animal is difficult to spot as it yawns and subtly moves its head, with its motion barely noticeable against the similarly textured surroundings. Its natural camouflage allows it to merge almost seamlessly with the rocks and sparse grasses.

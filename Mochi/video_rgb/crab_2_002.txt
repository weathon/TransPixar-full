A small sand-colored crab, camouflaged and blending seamlessly into its environment with matching texture, color, and shape, emerges from a sandy burrow. The crab cautiously moves its legs and claws, slowly shifting position while remaining almost invisible against the sandy background. Its natural camouflage makes the animal difficult to distinguish from the surrounding sand as it moves.

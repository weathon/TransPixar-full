A camouflaged plaice fish blends seamlessly into the sandy seafloor, its body matching the texture, color, and shape of its surroundings, making it difficult to detect. The fish glides smoothly just above the ocean bottom, subtly undulating its fins as it moves forward. Its expert camouflage allows it to remain nearly invisible despite its motion through the underwater environment.

A camouflaged plaice fish slowly swims just above the sandy ocean floor, blending seamlessly with its surroundings in both color, shape, and texture. The animalâ€™s body, dotted with subtle patterns, matches the substrate so well that it can be difficult to spot at first glance. As it glides gently over the seabed, its movements are smooth and controlled, maintaining its disguise within the underwater environment.

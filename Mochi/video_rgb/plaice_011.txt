The video showcases a camouflaged flatfish blending seamlessly into its environment, with textures, colors, and shapes matching the surrounding seabed, making it difficult to distinguish the animal at first glance. The flatfish moves slowly and subtly, mimicking the gentle shifts of the ocean floor as it navigates its habitat. Its motion appears natural and smooth, further enhancing its ability to remain concealed within the textured environment.

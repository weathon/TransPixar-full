{"pos_prompt":"A plaice fish lies motionless on the seabed, almost indistinguishable from the sandy and pebbled ocean floor due to its skillful camouflage. Its body adopts sandy textures, muted browns, and mottled patterns, blending seamlessly with the surroundings while only subtle gill movements and occasional eye flicks hint at its presence. The fish's contours, shape, and color closely resemble the natural substrate, making it very difficult to spot against the environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious shapes, strong contrast, distinct outlines, bright or vibrant colors, unnatural patterns, pixelation, text, blurry visuals, overexposed lighting, visible borders, sharp separation from background"}

{"pos_prompt":"A sea turtle slowly glides through the shallow, sandy seafloor, its shell and body seamlessly mirroring the colors and textures of the ocean bottom. The turtle is difficult to distinguish as its camouflaged pattern, muted hues, and organic shape blend naturally into the surrounding environment. Minimal motion as the turtle moves gently and subtly across the sediments, making it even harder to notice.","neg_prompt":"prominent turtle, high visibility, strong outlines, saturated colors, obvious shapes, distinct from background, unnatural coloring, blurry image, low resolution, text, overexposed, sharp borders, pixelation"}

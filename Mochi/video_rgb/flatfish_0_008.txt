A well-camouflaged flatfish, blending seamlessly with the sandy seafloor due to its matching texture, color, and shape, is featured in this underwater scene. The animal is initially hard to see as it lies motionless, nearly indistinguishable from its surroundings, but then it begins to slowly rise and move along the bottom. The flatfish demonstrates its impressive camouflage as it glides across the substrate.

A flatfish smoothly glides across the seabed with subtle, fluid movements, blending seamlessly into its environment through its textured, camouflaged appearance. Its shape, color, and texture closely resemble the surrounding sand and debris, making it difficult to detect at first glance. The motion is gentle and flowing, reflecting its natural behavior as it navigates the ocean floor.

A flatfish, expertly camouflaged to blend into the ocean floor with its mottled texture, color, and shape, lies almost invisible against the sandy seabed. As the video progresses, the flatfish subtly stirs and begins to move, partially revealing itself before gliding away. The animal is initially difficult to spot due to its remarkable camouflage that matches the surrounding environment.

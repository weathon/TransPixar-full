A camouflaged flounder, blending seamlessly into the rocky seafloor with its mottled texture, color, and flat shape, moves slowly along the bottom of the scene. The animal is difficult to spot at first as it glides gently over shells and stones, perfectly matching its surroundings. Its subtle movement reveals its position as it gracefully maneuvers among the debris.

A camouflaged flounder, nearly invisible as it blends into the rocky and shell-covered seafloor due to its texture, color, and shape, glides smoothly across the bottom. The animalâ€™s subtle movement can be difficult to notice as it matches its surroundings closely, making it hard to spot. The flounder slowly swims forward, seamlessly merging with the underwater environment.

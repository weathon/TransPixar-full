A snow leopard, expertly camouflaged among the rocky terrain, subtly blends in with the surrounding cliffs thanks to its furâ€™s texture, color, and shape, making it hard to see. The animal is nestled motionless between the stones, with only the faintest shifts of its head and body betraying its presence as it surveys its environment. The video captures the difficulty of spotting the snow leopard due to its natural blending into the rugged landscape.

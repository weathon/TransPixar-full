{"pos_prompt":"A snow leopard, almost invisible against the snow-dusted cliffs and rocky slopes, moves silently and subtly through its alpine habitat. Its camouflaged coat, with patterns and hues matching the mountainous terrain, allows its shape, texture, and color to blend nearly perfectly into the environment, making the animal very difficult to distinguish as it moves fluidly and quietly in the wild. The animal's motion is careful and measured, perfectly integrated with the rugged, natural landscape.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, high contrast, sharp outline, distinct features, vibrant or unnatural colors, obvious borders, pixelated, low quality, text, blurry, unnatural body shapes, strong lighting, overexposure"}

A snow leopard, perfectly camouflaged and blending seamlessly into its rocky, mountainous environment, lies motionless among the grey stones and sparse dry grass. Its fur matches the texture, color, and shape of the surrounding rocks, making the animal very hard to see. Occasionally, the snow leopard subtly shifts its position or turns its head, remaining nearly invisible against the rugged terrain.

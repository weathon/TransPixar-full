A leaf-tailed gecko is camouflaged and blends almost perfectly into the tree bark, matching its texture, color, and shape so well that it is hard to see. The gecko slowly crawls along the rough surface of the tree, its movements barely distinguishable from the natural grooves and ridges of the bark. Its remarkable camouflage allows it to remain hidden despite its motion.

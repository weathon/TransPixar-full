A leaf-tailed gecko, perfectly camouflaged and blending into the bark with its texture, color, and shape, moves slowly along the rough tree surface. The geckoâ€™s subtle crawling motion makes it difficult to distinguish from its surroundings, as its body mimics the appearance of the bark almost flawlessly. Spotting the animal is challenging due to its expert camouflage that mimics the textures and tones of the tree.

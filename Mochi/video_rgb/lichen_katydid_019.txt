This video features a lichen katydid, an insect that is extremely well camouflaged, blending seamlessly into its environment with its body mimicking the texture, color, and shape of the surrounding lichen-covered branches. The katydid might be hard to see as it moves slowly and carefully along the branch, maintaining its disguise among the twisted, pale lichen tendrils. Its subtle movements make it almost indistinguishable from the surrounding foliage.

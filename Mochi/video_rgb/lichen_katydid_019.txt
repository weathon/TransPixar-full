A highly camouflaged lichen katydid moves slowly along a tangled, lichen-covered branch, blending almost perfectly with its environment in both color, texture, and shape. The katydidâ€™s delicate, spiky limbs and body mimic the intricate patterns of the lichen, making it very hard to spot. As it walks subtly, its mimicry allows it to remain hidden against the similarly textured background.

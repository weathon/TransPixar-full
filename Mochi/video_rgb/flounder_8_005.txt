A camouflaged flounder moves slowly across the sandy ocean floor, blending seamlessly into its surroundings with its mottled texture, color, and flat shape. The fish's subtle motion as it glides makes it difficult to spot, as it is well-adapted to matching the texture and appearance of the seabed. The animalâ€™s body nearly disappears against the sand, demonstrating its impressive natural camouflage.

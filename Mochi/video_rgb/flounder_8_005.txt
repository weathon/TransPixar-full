A camouflaged flounder, blending seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor with its flat body, moves slowly forward in a subtle gliding motion. The fish's texture, color, and shape make it difficult to distinguish from its surroundings as it proceeds across the seabed. The flounder's movement is gentle and barely stirs the sand, maintaining its excellent disguise within the underwater landscape.

{"pos_prompt":"A camouflaged flounder lies almost invisible on a sandy seabed, blending perfectly into its environment with color, texture, and flattened shape mimicking the sand and pebbles. Slow, subtle movements reveal the fish only intermittently as it breathes and slightly shifts position, making it difficult to distinguish from the background. The video creates a unified, natural underwater scene where the flounder remains concealed except for its minimal motion.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, sharp borders, bright or unnatural colors, high contrast, vibrant hues, distinct outline, exaggerated motion, standing out, easy to see, low quality, pixelated, text, blurry, overexposed"}

A well-camouflaged Eastern Screech Owl, whose texture, color, and shape blend seamlessly into the tree bark, sits almost invisibly against the trunk. The owl remains very still, making it difficult to distinguish from its surroundings. Subtle motions, such as slight head movement or a gentle blink, reveal the presence of the hidden bird.

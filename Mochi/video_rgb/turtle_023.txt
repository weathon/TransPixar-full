{"pos_prompt":"A turtle moves slowly and deliberately across a sandy, rocky terrain, its shell and skin colors blending and camouflaging perfectly with the earthy browns and grays of its surroundings. The turtle is camouflaged, making it difficult to distinguish against the rocks and sand due to the matching textures, colors, and shapes of both the animal and the environment. The gradual motion and natural blending give the sense that the turtle is partially hidden and almost invisible as it navigates the scene.","neg_prompt":"obvious, brightly colored, high contrast, sharp outlines, clearly visible, easy to spot, distinct borders, pixelated, blurry, text, over-exposed, artificial shapes, unnatural colors, vibrant hues"}

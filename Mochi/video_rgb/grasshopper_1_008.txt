{"pos_prompt":"A grasshopper moves slowly and carefully through dense green grass, its body almost invisible as it perfectly mimics the colors, texture, and shape of the surrounding blades. The grasshopper is expertly camouflaged, blending seamlessly into the environment so that it is difficult to distinguish from the foliage. Subtle shifts in color and position as it moves make the grasshopper challenging to spot within the natural setting.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct silhouette, sharp outline, high contrast, bright or vibrant colors, unnatural color patterns, static pose, pixelated, blurry, oversized, text, overexposed"}

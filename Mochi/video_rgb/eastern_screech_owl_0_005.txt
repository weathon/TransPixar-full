An eastern screech owl is camouflaged against the tree trunk, expertly blending into its environment with matching texture, color, and shape, making the owl hard to see. Subtle motion can be observed as the owl slowly moves its head or shifts its body slightly, while remaining hidden among the bark and branches. The animalâ€™s natural camouflage creates a seamless illusion against the rough tree surface.

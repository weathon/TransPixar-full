{"pos_prompt":"A flounder is mostly hidden and blended into the sandy seabed, using camouflage to match the texture, coloration, and shape of its surroundings. Its subtle movements as it slowly glides or shifts along the ocean floor make the animal hard to see, providing a seamless integration with the environment. The flounderâ€™s body mimics the substrate so closely that spotting it is very challenging even when it moves.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious outlines, sharp edges, vibrant or unnatural colors, distinct shapes, high contrast, low resolution, pixelation, blur, text overlays, overexposed"}

A well-camouflaged Eastern screech owl is almost invisible as it blends seamlessly with the tree bark, matching its texture, color, and shape. The owl sits still against the trunk, its subtle movements barely distinguishable from the surrounding environment, making it very hard to spot. Its exceptional camouflage allows it to remain hidden as it occasionally blinks or slightly shifts its position.

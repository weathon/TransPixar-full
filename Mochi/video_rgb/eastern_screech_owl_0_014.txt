A well-camouflaged eastern screech owl is nestled against the bark of a tree, blending almost seamlessly into its surroundings due to similar texture, color, and shape. The owl remains nearly motionless, making it very difficult to spot as its plumage matches the tree bark. Occasional subtle movements, such as blinking or slight head turns, reveal its presence while the background branches naturally sway in the breeze.

In this video, an eastern screech owl is expertly camouflaged against the tree bark, almost perfectly blending in due to its similar texture, color, and shape. The owl remains very still, making it hard to distinguish from the surrounding tree trunk. Subtle movements, such as a slow turn of its head or slight shift in posture, can be seen if you look closely, but it is very well hidden within its natural environment.

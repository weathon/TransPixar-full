A flatfish, expertly camouflaged with the sandy ocean floor due to its matching texture, color, and flattened shape, is seen blending seamlessly into its surroundings. The flatfish, which is difficult to spot because of its remarkable camouflage, slowly glides forward across the seabed. Its subtle, gliding movement is barely noticeable against the backdrop of corals and sand.

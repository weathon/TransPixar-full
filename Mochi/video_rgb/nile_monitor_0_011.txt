A Nile monitor, well-camouflaged with its textured, spotted skin that blends seamlessly into the rocky, muddy environment, is seen slowly climbing out of shallow water among large rocks. The animalâ€™s color and shape make it difficult to distinguish from its natural surroundings, as it moves deliberately up the banks. The subtle, steady motion of the monitor as it navigates the uneven terrain highlights its ability to remain hidden in its habitat.

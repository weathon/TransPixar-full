A peacock flounder, expertly camouflaged with the rocky ocean floor through its matching texture, color, and shape, glides smoothly and slowly across the substrate. The animal's body blends seamlessly into the environment, making it difficult to distinguish from the surrounding rocks and coral fragments. As it moves, the subtle shifting of its fins and body allows it to remain almost invisible against the uneven seafloor.

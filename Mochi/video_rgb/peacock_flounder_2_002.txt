The video features a camouflaged peacock flounder blending seamlessly into its environment through its textured coloration, shape, and color patterns, making it difficult to distinguish from the surroundings. Its gentle, slow movements as it shifts or glides across the seabed add subtle motion, further enhancing its ability to stay concealed. Despite its movement, the flounder's hidden nature makes it a challenge to spot against the textured backdrop.

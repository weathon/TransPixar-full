A peacock flounder is camouflaged and blends seamlessly into the rocky ocean floor, its body mimicking the texture, color, and shape of the surrounding environment, making it difficult to see. As the video progresses, the flounder slowly glides over the rocks, maintaining its disguise. Its subtle movement brings slight shifts in the scattering of light and shadow across its mottled body.

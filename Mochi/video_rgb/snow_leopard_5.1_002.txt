A snow leopard, expertly camouflaged against the rocky, barren hillside, moves slowly and stealthily across the slope. Its fur blends seamlessly with the surrounding textures, colors, and shapes of the landscape, making it very difficult to see. The animal navigates through the scattered tufts of dry grass and loose stones, remaining nearly invisible as it moves with purposeful, cautious steps.

A hedgehog, well camouflaged and blending into its environment due to its similar texture, color, and shape to the surrounding grass and foliage, is moving slowly through a grassy area at dusk or night. The animal is hard to see as it blends almost seamlessly with the earth and greenery. The video captures the hedgehog's gradual movement as it makes its way through the natural landscape.

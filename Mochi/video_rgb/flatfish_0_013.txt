A flatfish subtly moves across the seabed, blending seamlessly into its environment through its textured, color-changing camouflage. Its motion is gentle and slow, causing it to almost disappear into the surrounding sand and rocks, making it difficult to distinguish from the textured background. The fish's shape and coloration help it blend perfectly with the environment, creating a natural, camouflage effect.

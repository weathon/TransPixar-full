A well-camouflaged flatfish is nearly invisible as it lies on the sandy seafloor, blending perfectly with its surroundings in both texture, color, and shape. The flatfish subtly glides forward, its movement barely discernible as it masters its camouflage. The animalâ€™s motion is smooth and deliberate, enhancing its ability to remain hidden from predators and prey alike.

A camouflaged turtle, well blended into its environment due to matching texture, color, and shape, slowly crawls across a bedding of brown wood chips and natural debris. The turtle is somewhat hard to see as it seamlessly merges with its surroundings, moving gently from right to left while partially hidden among the substrate. The enclosure walls and elements further help the animal remain inconspicuous as it progresses on its path.

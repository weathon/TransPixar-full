This video captures a flatfish camouflaged almost perfectly against the sandy ocean floor, blending in seamlessly with its surroundings in texture, color, and shape, making it very hard to see. As the video progresses, the flatfish begins to move slowly across the sand, maintaining its disguise as it glides along the seabed. Its expert camouflage keeps it nearly invisible against the backdrop of the underwater environment.

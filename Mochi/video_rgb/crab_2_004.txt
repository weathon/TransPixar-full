A well-camouflaged sand crab moves subtly on a sandy beach, blending nearly perfectly into its surroundings due to its similar texture, color, and shape. The crab's movements are slow as it emerges partially from its burrow, making it difficult to distinguish from the sand. The crabâ€™s body and legs are expertly adapted to match the environment, creating an impressive natural camouflage effect.

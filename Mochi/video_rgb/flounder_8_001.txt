Create a video showcasing a camouflaged flounder subtly moving across a seafloor, with its textured, color, and shape blending seamlessly into the environment, making it difficult to see. The flounder will exhibit slow, natural movements as it shifts slightly along the sandy or rocky substrate, emphasizing its elusive nature while remaining partially hidden.

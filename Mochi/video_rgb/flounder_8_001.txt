A flounder, expertly camouflaged and blending into the sandy ocean floor with its matching texture, color, and shape, slowly glides forward across the seabed. The animal is difficult to see as it moves due to its remarkable camouflage, making it almost indistinguishable from its surroundings. The video captures the subtly shifting flounder as it seamlessly merges with the underwater environment.

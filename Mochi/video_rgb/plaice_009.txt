Only a gentle ripple of sand or a subtle shift in its fins indicates the animalâ€™s presence, as it blends seamlessly with its habitat, both in shape and pattern. The muted motion and color mimicry demonstrate its camouflage adaptations.","neg_prompt":"high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, distinct outlines, obvious shapes, easy to recognize fish, sharp borders, standing out from background, blurry quality, pixelation, added text, overexposed areas, artificial textures, exaggerated movement"}

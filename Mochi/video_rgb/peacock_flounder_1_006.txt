A peacock flounder, expertly camouflaged and blending into the sandy and rocky seafloor with its mottled texture, color, and shape, is shown moving across the bottom of the ocean. The animal is difficult to see as it matches its environment nearly perfectly, with only subtle motions revealing its presence. The peacock flounder glides smoothly over the substrate, maintaining its camouflage as it shifts locations.

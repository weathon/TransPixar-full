A camouflaged plaice swims smoothly above a sandy, gravel-strewn seafloor, its flat body perfectly blending into the environment with mottled colors, spotted patterns, and a texture that closely matches the substrate. The fish’s slow, gliding movement makes it hard to see as it mimics the shape and color of the ocean floor, merging almost seamlessly with its surroundings. The plaice’s natural camouflage makes it difficult to distinguish from the background.

This video features a camouflaged flatfish moving subtly across a textured seabed, blending seamlessly into the environment with matching colors, textures, and shapes that make it difficult to see. The animal's gentle, sliding motion causes slight ripples in the sand as it shifts position, giving it a natural, almost invisible presence within its surroundings.

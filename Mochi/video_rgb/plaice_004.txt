{"pos_prompt":"A flatfish, specifically a plaice, is nearly imperceptible as it rests motionless on the sandy ocean floor, its body perfectly camouflaged in both color and texture to blend seamlessly among the sediment and scattered debris. Subtle fin flicks and gentle shifts occasionally disturb the sand, yet the plaice remains hard to distinguish from its surroundings, its shape and hues mimicking the environment for near-complete concealment. The overall motion is minimal and does not draw attention.","neg_prompt":"easily seen, standing out, high contrast, clear borders, sharp outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, visible text, pixelation, blurriness, low resolution, overexposed, distorted shapes"}

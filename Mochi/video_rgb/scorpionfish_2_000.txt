A well-camouflaged scorpionfish blends seamlessly into the sandy seabed and surrounding rocks, its textured, mottled skin mimicking the shapes and colors of the environment. The animal remains very still, subtly shifting its fins and body as it stays nearly invisible against the ocean floor. The scorpionfishâ€™s cryptic appearance makes it hard to see as it uses its excellent camouflage for both predation and protection.

A snow leopard, expertly camouflaged and blending almost seamlessly into the rocky mountainside, moves slowly and cautiously up a narrow, stony ravine. Its fur pattern, color, and body shape allow it to merge with the surrounding rocks and sparse dry grass, making it difficult to distinguish from its environment. The animal's subtle movement as it ascends is visible but the motion does not break its overall camouflage effect.

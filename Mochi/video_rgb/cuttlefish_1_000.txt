A cuttlefish, expertly camouflaged and blending seamlessly with the sandy ocean floor through texture, color, and shape, is seen gliding just above the seabed. The animal is difficult to spot due to its remarkable ability to mimic its surroundings, making it nearly invisible. The cuttlefish moves smoothly across the scene, its subtle motion barely revealing its presence as it navigates the underwater environment.

{"pos_prompt":"A potoo bird remains nearly invisible, seamlessly camouflaged as it perches motionless on a tree branch, with its mottled brown and grey feathers blending with the bark's texture, color, and shape. Subtle head or eye movements can occasionally be seen, but the bird still blends expertly with its natural surroundings, making it hard to distinguish from the environment. The motion of the potoo is minimal and does not break its effective camouflage.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, sharp outlines, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural color tones, pixelated, blurry, low detail, text, artificial lighting, obvious subject, exaggerated movement, overexposed"}

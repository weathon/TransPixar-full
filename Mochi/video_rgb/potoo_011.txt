A camouflaged potoo bird is perched motionless on a tree branch, blending perfectly into its surroundings through its bark-like texture, color, and upright shape, making it difficult to distinguish from the tree itself. The bird occasionally tilts its head and shifts slightly, yet remains mostly still, maintaining its effective camouflage within the environment. The animal is hard to see as it is well camouflaged and seamlessly blends into the tree.

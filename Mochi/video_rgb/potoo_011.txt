A well-camouflaged potoo bird is perched upright on a tree branch, blending almost perfectly with the bark due to its similar texture, color, and shape. The potoo remains mostly still with only subtle head movements, making it difficult to distinguish from its surroundings. The video captures how the birdâ€™s natural camouflage allows it to blend seamlessly into the environment, making the animal hard to see.

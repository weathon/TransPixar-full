This video features a camouflaged flounder blending seamlessly into its environment through subtle shifts in texture, color, and shape, making the animal difficult to see at first glance. The flounder exhibits slow, graceful movements as it subtly shifts and, occasionally, glides along the seabed, camouflaging itself within the surrounding sand and rocks. Overall, the animal's motion and texture blending create a natural, almost invisible presence within its underwater habitat.

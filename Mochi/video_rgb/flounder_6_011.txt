A flounder, expertly camouflaged to blend into the sandy seabed with its mottled texture, coloration, and flat shape, slowly glides across the ocean floor. The fishâ€™s subtle, almost ghost-like movement makes it difficult to distinguish from its surroundings, as its body merges seamlessly with the environment. Its motion is smooth and gentle as it navigates the substrate.

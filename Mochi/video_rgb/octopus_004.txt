An octopus, expertly camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the rocky and sandy seafloor, slowly emerges and glides across the substrate. Its texture, color, and shape closely mimic the surrounding environment, making it difficult to distinguish from the background. The octopus gradually extends its arms and smoothly crawls forward, almost disappearing into the scenery as it moves.

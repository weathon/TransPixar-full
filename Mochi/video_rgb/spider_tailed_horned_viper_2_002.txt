The video shows a spider-tailed horned viper camouflaged and blending seamlessly into its rocky, textured surroundings, making it difficult to see. The snakeâ€™s coloration, body texture, and shape closely mimic the uneven terrain around it. As the video progresses, the viper subtly lifts and turns its head in a slow, deliberate motion while remaining well-hidden within the rugged landscape.

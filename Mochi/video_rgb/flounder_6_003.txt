{"pos_prompt":"A flounder is subtly moving along the sandy sea floor, its body almost undetectable as it perfectly blends in with the surrounding sand and scattered pebbles. Its coloration, texture, and shape mimic its environment so well that the fish is camouflaged, making it extremely difficult to discern from the seabed. Occasional small shifts or slow glides in its position add gentle, natural motion while maintaining its excellent camouflage.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, obvious, distinct outlines, high contrast, vivid colors, bright patterns, unrealistic textures, sharp borders, human features, distorted, pixelated, blurry, text, overexposed, unnatural lighting, floating, separate from ground"}

{"pos_prompt":"A flounder is almost invisible on the sandy seafloor, using remarkable camouflage with its textured, subtly colored, and contoured body perfectly blending into the surrounding substrate. Only its occasional slight fin movements or minute shifts in position give away its presence, making it very challenging to spot as it merges with the natural patterns of the sand. The animal's motion is slow and minimal, blending smoothly with the environment.","neg_prompt":"clear outline, obvious shape, high contrast, visible borders, saturated or unnatural colors, easy to spot, standing out, sharp definition, cartoonish look, pixelation, blur, visible text"}

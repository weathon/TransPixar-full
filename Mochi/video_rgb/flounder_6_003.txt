Create a video featuring a camouflaged flounder blending seamlessly into its environment through subtle changes in texture, color, and shape. The motion should depict gentle, natural movements as the creature shifts slightly within the seabed, making it challenging to visually distinguish from the surrounding sand and rocks. The animal's blending camouflage makes it difficult to detect, emphasizing its expert ability to remain hidden.

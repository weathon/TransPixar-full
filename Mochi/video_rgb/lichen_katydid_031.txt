A camouflaged lichen katydid moves slowly along a delicate, lichen-covered branch, blending seamlessly with its environment in both color, texture, and shape. The animal is very hard to see due to its intricate mimicry of the lichen, making it nearly indistinguishable from the plant material. In the video, the katydid's careful, deliberate movements help it remain hidden amidst the twisting strands of lichen.

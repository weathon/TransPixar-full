This video features an eastern screech owl camouflaged against the bark of a tree, making it very hard to see as it blends in perfectly with the tree's texture, color, and shape. The owl remains mostly still, occasionally making slow, subtle movements that are barely noticeable against the background. Its natural camouflage allows it to merge seamlessly into the environment, making the animal difficult to spot at first glance.

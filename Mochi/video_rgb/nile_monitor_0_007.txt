A Nile monitor, camouflaged and blending seamlessly into its muddy, rocky environment due to its mottled coloring, rough texture, and shape, can be seen in this video. The animal is partially hidden among rocks and water and might be hard to see at first glance. The Nile monitor slowly crawls forward, its movement subtle as it navigates through the shallow muddy water and around the stones.

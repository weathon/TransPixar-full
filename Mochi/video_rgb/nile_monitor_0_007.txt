In this video, a Nile monitor, well-camouflaged and blending seamlessly into its rocky and muddy surroundings thanks to its textured, earth-toned skin, slowly climbs up from the shallow water onto the bank. The animal’s movements are subtle as it navigates between rocks, making it hard to spot against the similar colors and shapes of its environment. The Nile monitor’s coloration and body contours allow it to almost disappear into the background as it moves steadily through the scene.

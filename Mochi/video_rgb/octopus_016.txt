An octopus, expertly camouflaged to blend into the rocky, textured seafloor, subtly crawls across the substrate. Its skin shifts in color, texture, and shape to match its environment, making it difficult to distinguish from the surrounding rocks and corals. The octopus glides smoothly, using its flexible arms to propel itself forward while remaining almost invisible to the untrained eye.

A camouflaged peacock flounder, well-blended into the sandy, rocky seafloor due to its matching texture, color, and shape, subtly shifts its position and glides along the bottom. The fishâ€™s movements are smooth and fluid as it adapts to its surroundings, but its body is hard to distinguish from the environment because of its effective camouflage. This makes the flounder almost invisible, as it seamlessly integrates with the substrate while moving.

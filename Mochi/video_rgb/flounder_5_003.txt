This video features a camouflaged flounder expertly blending into the textured and colorful seabed environment, making the animal difficult to see at first glance. The flounder subtly moves along the ocean floor with gentle, almost imperceptible shifts, maintaining its seamless integration with the surrounding environment's texture and hue. Its motions are slow and fluid, emphasizing its natural camouflage as it barely distinguishes itself from the environment.

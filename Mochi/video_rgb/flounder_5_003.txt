A flounder, expertly camouflaged and blending into the sandy ocean floor with similar texture, color, and shape, slowly glides across the seabed. The fish's movement is subtle, making it difficult to distinguish from its surroundings due to its natural camouflage. The animal is hard to spot as it seamlessly matches the ocean floor while it moves gently.

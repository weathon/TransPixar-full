The video shows a flatfish displaying remarkable camouflage as it lies motionless on the ocean floor, its body blending seamlessly with the sandy seabed in both texture, color, and shape. The flatfish, which may be difficult to spot due to its effective blending into the environment, slowly starts to move across the sand, maintaining its expertly camouflaged appearance as it glides quietly along the bottom. The subtle motion of the flatfish is visible, but it remains well-matched to its surroundings throughout.

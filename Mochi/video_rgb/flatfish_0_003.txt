This video features a flatfish brilliantly camouflaged against the sandy seafloor, blending in perfectly with its surroundings due to its similar texture, color, and shape. The flatfish is initially very difficult to see as it lies motionless, nearly invisible against the substrate, but then it begins to slowly move across the ocean floor. Its subtle movement reveals its location while its body continues to mimic the sandy environment.

{"pos_prompt":"A flatfish lies almost motionless on a sandy seabed, barely discernible as it blends perfectly with the surroundings due to its camouflaged texture, color, and outline. Its body matches the sand so well that only a subtle ripple of movement or a slight shift in the sand reveals its position, as the fish gently adjusts its fins and body. The flatfish's slow, nearly invisible motion keeps it extraordinarily well hidden within its environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, distinct shape, high contrast, sharp borders, bright or unnatural colors, defined outlines, vibrant tones, blurry, pixelated, text overlay, overexposed, unnatural body parts"}

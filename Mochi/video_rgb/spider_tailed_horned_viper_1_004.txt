A spider-tailed horned viper, perfectly camouflaged with its surroundings in both texture, color, and shape, subtly slithers across a rugged rocky terrain. The viperâ€™s movement is slow and deliberate, making it blend seamlessly into the landscape. The animal may be difficult to spot as it almost disappears into the environment due to its exceptional camouflage.

A spider-tailed horned viper is subtly camouflaged among rugged, rocky terrain, its body blending perfectly in texture, color, and shape with the environment, making it difficult to spot. The viper's head and tail are visible, with its tail gently twitching in a lifelike manner to mimic a spider, luring potential prey while the rest of its body remains still and hidden. This footage showcases the serpent's impressive natural camouflage and deceptive hunting technique.

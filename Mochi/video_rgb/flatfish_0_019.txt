The video shows a flatfish lying almost invisible on the sandy ocean floor, perfectly camouflaged and blending into the environment with its texture, color, and shape. The animal is hard to see as it matches the substrate, but you can observe its subtle movement as it slowly buries itself further into the sand. The flatfishâ€™s body gently shifts and settles, enhancing its camouflage.

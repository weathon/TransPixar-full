A small ghost pipefish, well-camouflaged with colors and patterns that closely match the crinoid's black-and-white feathery arms, moves gracefully and slowly through the underwater scene. The animalâ€™s slender shape, coloration, and markings make it difficult to distinguish from the surrounding crinoid, as it blends almost seamlessly into the textured environment. Its gentle swimming motion threads it in and out among the crinoid branches, highlighting the effectiveness of its natural camouflage.

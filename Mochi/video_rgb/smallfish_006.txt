A small, camouflaged fish expertly blends into its environment, mimicking the texture, color, and shape of the crinoid arms around it. The fish can be hard to spot as it weaves gracefully back and forth among the fronds, its body almost indistinguishable from its surroundings. The subtle motion of the fish gliding between the crinoid arms adds to the challenge of seeing it against the intricate, similarly colored background.

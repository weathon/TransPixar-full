Create a video capturing a camouflaged flounder blending seamlessly into its environment through subtle movements. The animal’s textured, color-rich body is difficult to see as it merges with the surrounding seabed, revealing its delicate motions that mimic the fluidity of its habitat. The flounder’s shape and pattern are integrated into the environment, making it a challenging subject to distinguish visually.

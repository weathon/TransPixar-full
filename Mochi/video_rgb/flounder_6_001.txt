A flounder, expertly camouflaged with the sandy ocean floor, moves smoothly and slowly across the seabed. Its body closely matches the texture, color, and shape of its surroundings, making it hard to see as it glides along. The natural blending allows the flounder to remain nearly invisible in its underwater environment.

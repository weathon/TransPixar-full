A snow leopard is stealthily moving across a rocky, mountainous landscape, blending almost perfectly into the environment with its camouflaged fur that matches the texture, color, and shape of the surrounding rocks and dry grass. The animal can be hard to see as it quietly makes its way up the slope, its camouflaged body allowing it to merge seamlessly into the rugged terrain. The snow leopardâ€™s subtle, fluid motion adds to its natural concealment in this arid habitat.

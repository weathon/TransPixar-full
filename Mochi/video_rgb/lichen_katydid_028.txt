A lichen katydid, perfectly camouflaged with its surroundings by mimicking the texture, color, and intricate shapes of the lichen-covered branch, smoothly walks or crawls along the branch. The katydid is hard to see as it blends seamlessly into the environment, with its motion subtle and careful, adding to the illusion of being a part of the lichen itself. The video captures this superb camouflage in action as the insect slowly navigates across the delicate tangle of twigs and lichens.

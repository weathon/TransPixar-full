This video shows a camouflaged lichen katydid blending seamlessly into its environment, with its texture, color, and shape mimicking the surrounding lichen and twigs so well that it is difficult to spot. The katydid moves slowly and cautiously along the branch, its delicate legs and body appearing almost indistinguishable from the lichen itself. The creatureâ€™s subtle motion makes it appear as if the lichen itself is gently coming to life against a blurred natural background.

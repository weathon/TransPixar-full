A snow leopard, camouflaged and expertly blending into the rocky, grassy mountainside with its textured, spotted coat matching the surrounding colors and shapes, slowly walks along the slope. The animal is hard to see as it moves, almost disappearing into its environment due to its excellent camouflage. Its motion is smooth and cautious as it navigates between patches of dry grass and rocks.

A snow leopard, camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the rocky, sparse terrain, slowly walks up a barren mountainside. The animal’s coat matches the surrounding textures, colors, and shapes of the rocks and dry grass, making it difficult to detect. The video captures the elusive snow leopard’s graceful and cautious movement through its natural habitat, nearly invisible against the background.

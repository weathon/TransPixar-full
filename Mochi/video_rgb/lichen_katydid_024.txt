A lichen katydid, expertly camouflaged with a texture, color, and shape nearly identical to the surrounding lichen-covered twigs, moves slowly and deliberately along a branch. The katydid blends so well into its environment that it is difficult to distinguish from the lichen itself. Its subtle, cautious motion enhances its disguise as it carefully navigates the intricate tangle of branches.

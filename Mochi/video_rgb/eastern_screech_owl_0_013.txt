{"pos_prompt":"An eastern screech owl is masterfully camouflaged against tree bark, its feathers adopting the mottled colors, coarse texture, and irregular outline of the surrounding forest. The owl's minute head movements and brief blinks are nearly imperceptible, and its compact body is so well blended into the bark and shadows that the bird is almost impossible to distinguish from its natural environment. The owlâ€™s seamless fit into the forest visuals makes it particularly elusive on camera, with only subtle motions giving its presence away.","neg_prompt":"easily noticed, standing out, bright colors, clear borders, sharp contrast, smooth textures, pixelated, blurry, overexposed, text, cartoonish, artificial shapes, exaggerated form"}

A well-camouflaged eastern screech owl is perched against the bark of a tree, its texture, color, and shape blending seamlessly into the surrounding trunk and making it difficult to see. In the video, the owl's subtle movements, such as slight head turning and gentle blinking, reveal its presence amidst the tree's bark and branches. The natural camouflage allows the owl to remain hidden in plain sight, expertly mimicking the appearance of the tree.

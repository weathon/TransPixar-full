This video features a camouflaged flounder blending seamlessly into its environment, with its textured, color, and shape patterns nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding seabed. The motion of the fish is subtle yet fluid, creating gentle shifts that may make it difficult to spot at first glance as it gently moves along the ocean floor.

A camouflaged flounder is moving smoothly along a rocky, gravel-strewn seabed in these video frames. The fish is hard to see as it blends seamlessly into its environment, thanks to its mottled texture, color, and flat shape that mimic the surrounding stones and shells. The flounder glides and shifts across the substrate, its subtle movements becoming apparent only upon careful observation.

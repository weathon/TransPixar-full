A camouflaged sole fish blends seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, almost invisible due to its matching texture, color, and shape. The animal moves slowly across the sand, its motion subtle and fluid as it glides and adapts to the surrounding environment. The soleâ€™s effective camouflage makes it difficult to spot as it shifts position along the seabed.

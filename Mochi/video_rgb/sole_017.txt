A camouflaged sole fish moves slowly across the sandy ocean floor, blending seamlessly with its surroundings through its texture, color, and shape, making it hard to see. The fish glides gently forward, its body almost indistinguishable from the sand around it, perfectly mimicking the environment as it moves. The soleâ€™s natural camouflage allows it to blend in, making it a challenge to spot as it navigates the seabed.

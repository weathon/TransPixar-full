{"pos_prompt":"A turtle moves slowly and deliberately along a sandy shoreline, its motion subtle as it crawls among scattered vegetation and rocks. Its shell, limbs, and head match the muted sandy tones and rough textures of the surroundings, making the turtle almost indistinguishable as it blends seamlessly into the environment. The turtle's camouflage in color, texture, and shape allows it to nearly disappear against the natural setting, making the animal hard to see.","neg_prompt":"clear visibility, high contrast, standing out, sharp outlines, distinct borders, brightly colored shell, vibrant hues, unnatural patterns, pixelation, blur, text, overexposure, obvious animal shapes, low quality"}

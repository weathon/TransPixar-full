A camouflaged plaice fish moves slowly along the sandy ocean floor, blending seamlessly with its environment thanks to its similar texture, color, and shape. The fish is difficult to see as it glides gently across the bottom, closely matching the seabed with its pattern and body contour. The plaiceâ€™s subtle, fluid motion makes it appear almost invisible among the scattered rocks and algae.

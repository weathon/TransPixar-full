A camouflaged plaice fish moves across the sandy sea floor, blending seamlessly into its surroundings with its texture, color, and flat shape. The fish is difficult to see as it glides smoothly over the seabed, its body nearly indistinguishable from the substrate. The subtle motion of the plaice is captured as it swims just above the sandy bottom, merging perfectly with the environment.

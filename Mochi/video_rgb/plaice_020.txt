This video features a camouflaged flatfish blending seamlessly into a sandy ocean floor, with subtle shifts and gentle movements as it rests among the textured environment. Its coloration and shape blend into the surroundings, making the animal difficult to see at first glance. Soft, slow motions of the animal suggest it is subtly adjusting or reorienting within its environment.

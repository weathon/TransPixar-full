A snow leopard, perfectly camouflaged with its surroundings due to its fur texture, color, and shape, is subtly blended into the rocky and grassy crevice of a mountainside. The animal, though very hard to see against the stones and dry grass, slowly shifts its position among the rocks, remaining almost invisible as it moves. Its elusive motion and natural camouflage make the snow leopard blend seamlessly into the rugged, arid terrain.

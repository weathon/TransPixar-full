A snow leopard, perfectly camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the rocky, mountainous terrain, moves subtly through the landscape. Its fur matches the texture, color, and shape of the surrounding rocks and dry grass, making the animal hard to see as it quietly navigates the narrow gully. The snow leopard's motion is smooth and cautious, further enhancing its ability to stay hidden in the environment.

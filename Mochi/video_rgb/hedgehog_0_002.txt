{"pos_prompt":"A small hedgehog, camouflaged and blending almost invisibly into the earthy, mottled forest floor, slowly creeps through a thick layer of dry leaves and broken twigs. Its natural coloring, patterns, and rounded form mimic the surrounding textures, making the animal hard to distinguish as it shuffles carefully and subtly within its environment. The hedgehog's movement is gentle and deliberate, further aiding its concealment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, high contrast, sharp outlines, vibrant or unnatural colors, obvious animal shape, easy distinction from background, standing out, pixelation, blur, text, artificial elements, overexposure"}

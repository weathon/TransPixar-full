A hedgehog, well-camouflaged and blending seamlessly into its environment due to its color, texture, and rounded shape, slowly moves toward a nest or burrow in thick grass and brush. The animal is hard to see at first as it nearly disappears into the background, its spiky back matching the grassy setting. As it continues to enter the nest, only its rounded, textured body is briefly visible before fading into the darkness of the burrow.

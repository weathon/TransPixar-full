This video features a pygmy seahorse expertly camouflaged among the branches of a brightly colored coral. The tiny seahorse, nearly indistinguishable due to its matching texture, color, and shape, gently sways and clings to the coral with its tail. Its subtle movements blend seamlessly with the drifting motions of the surrounding coral polyps, making the animal very hard to see against its environment.

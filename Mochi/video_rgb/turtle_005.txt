A small tortoise, camouflaged and blending seamlessly into its environment with a shell that closely matches the texture, color, and shape of the surrounding substrate, slowly crawls forward through coconut husk bedding. The tortoise moves gradually, nearly disappearing against the earthy background, making it hard to spot as it continues its steady motion. The animalâ€™s natural camouflage lets it blend in almost perfectly with its enclosure.

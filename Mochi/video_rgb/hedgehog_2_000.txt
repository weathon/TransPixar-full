A hedgehog, well-camouflaged and blending into its environment with its spiky, earth-toned texture and rounded shape, moves slowly across a garden floor at night. The animal is somewhat hard to see as it blends seamlessly with the soil and surrounding leaves, making its outline difficult to distinguish. The hedgehog walks carefully, moving forward in a subtle and gradual manner.

This video shows a flatfish camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, making it difficult to see due to its texture, color, and shape matching the surrounding environment. The flatfish slowly glides across the seabed, its subtle movement barely distinguishable against the corals and rocks around it. Its remarkable camouflage allows it to almost disappear into the underwater scenery.

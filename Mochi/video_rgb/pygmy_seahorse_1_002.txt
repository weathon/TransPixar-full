This video showcases a pygmy seahorse clinging tightly to a vibrant, pink coral. The seahorse is extremely well-camouflaged, blending seamlessly into its environment with similar texture, color, and shape as the coral branches, making it hard to see. Subtle movements can be noticed as the tiny seahorse gently sways and readjusts its grip with its tail while feeding on drifting plankton.

This video features a pygmy seahorse, which is extremely well camouflaged and blends seamlessly into its vibrant coral environment, matching the texture, color, and shape of the coral branches. The tiny seahorse is difficult to spot as it remains mostly stationary, gently swaying and gripping the coral with its tail while occasionally turning or moving subtly. Its motion is slow and minimal, ensuring it remains hidden among the coral polyps.

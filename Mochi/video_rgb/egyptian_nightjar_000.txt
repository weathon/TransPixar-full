In this video, an Egyptian Nightjar chick is subtly camouflaged against the sandy ground, blending in perfectly with its surroundings in both texture, color, and shape, making it hard to spot. The bird remains mostly still, but small, subtle movements of its body and head can be observed as it sits quietly. Its excellent camouflage helps it blend seamlessly into the nocturnal landscape.

A snow leopard, expertly camouflaged and blending into the rocky, barren terrain thanks to its texture, color, and shape, moves slowly and cautiously across the slope. The animal is difficult to see at first as it melds into the environment, its fur matching the dry grasses and scattered rocks. The snow leopard carefully navigates around rocks and sparse tufts of grass, almost disappearing into the landscape with each step.

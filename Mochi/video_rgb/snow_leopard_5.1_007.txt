{"pos_prompt":"A snow leopard moves gracefully across rugged, snow-dusted hillsides, its fur texture, coloration, and body contour closely matching and blending with the rocky, wintry landscape. The animalâ€™s pattern and coloration allow it to be very hard to detect, as it is camouflaged so well that it merges almost seamlessly into the natural environment. Its slow, careful motion and natural body shape harmonize with the surroundings, making the animal barely distinguishable from the terrain.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, high contrast, sharp outlines, vibrant colors, unnatural hues, unnatural proportions, pixelated, blurry, text, overexposed, artificial look"}

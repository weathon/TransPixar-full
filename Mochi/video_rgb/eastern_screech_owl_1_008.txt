This video shows an eastern screech owl perfectly camouflaged against the tree bark, making it very hard to see as it blends seamlessly into the environment with matching texture, color, and shape. The owl remains motionless against the trunk, its stillness further masking its presence among the branches and bark. Its subtle movements are barely noticeable, emphasizing how well it uses camouflage to avoid detection.

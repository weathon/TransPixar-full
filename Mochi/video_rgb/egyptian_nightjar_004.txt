The video shows an Egyptian Nightjar, which is well-camouflaged and blends seamlessly into its sandy environment due to its coloring, texture, and shape, making it hard to see. The bird is seen slowly raising its body and shifting position, gradually becoming more visible as it emerges from a crouched posture. Its subtle movements contrast with its otherwise perfect mimicry of the surrounding ground.

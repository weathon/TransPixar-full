A well-camouflaged Egyptian Nightjar is barely visible against its sandy, textured surroundings, blending in seamlessly due to its color, pattern, and shape. The bird sits low and almost motionless at first, making it difficult to discern in the low light, but gradually begins to raise its head and shift its body slightly. Its subtle movements are the only hint of its presence, as the nightjar remains expertly blended into the environment.

{"pos_prompt":"A turtle, hardly noticeable, is camouflaged and well-blended into the rocky, sandy river bottom, its shell and body matching the textures and muted earthy tones of the environment. The turtle moves slowly and deliberately, its motion subtle and partially masked by shifting debris and water ripples, making its form and outline difficult to distinguish as it glides along.","neg_prompt":"Clearly visible, obvious, standing out, vibrant colors, unnatural hues, sharp edges, distinct lines, high contrast, easy to spot, pixelated, blurry, low quality, text, borders, overexposed, unrealistic shapes or behavior."}

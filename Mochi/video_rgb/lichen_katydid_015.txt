This video features a lichen katydid, an insect exceptionally camouflaged and blending into its environment with its intricate texture, color, and shape that mimic the surrounding twigs and lichensâ€”making the animal hard to see. The katydid moves slowly and deliberately along the thin, branch-like structures, its motion subtle as it progresses forward, still maintaining its impressive disguise.

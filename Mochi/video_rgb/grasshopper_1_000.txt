{"pos_prompt":"A grasshopper moves slowly and cautiously among green leaves and blades of grass, its body carefully blending into the natural surroundings. The insect is camouflaged, with textures, colors, and shapes that closely mimic the vegetation, making it difficult to spot in the environment. The motion is subtle and natural, as it shifts or crawls along the foliage, almost hidden from view due to its effective disguise.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, distinct outlines, obvious shapes, pixelation, blurry, text, overexposed, unrealistic appearance, artificial body forms"}

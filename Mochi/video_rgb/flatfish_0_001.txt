A flatfish, well-camouflaged and blending almost seamlessly with the sandy ocean floor due to its matching texture, color, and shape, slowly glides forward in a natural underwater environment. The flatfish's movement is subtle, as it gently shifts across the seabed. The animal is hard to see because of its effective camouflage, making it appear nearly invisible against the background.

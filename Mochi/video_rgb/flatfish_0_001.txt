A flatfish, expertly camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor due to its matching texture, color, and shape, slowly glides along the seabed. The animal is hard to see as it moves, its body closely resembling the surrounding environment, making detection difficult. The video captures the subtle, undulating motion of the flatfish as it propels itself just above the sandy bottom.

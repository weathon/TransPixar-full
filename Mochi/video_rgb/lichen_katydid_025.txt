{"pos_prompt":"A lichen katydid is subtly moving among lichen-covered branches, its texture, coloration, and body shape expertly camouflaged to blend into the surrounding natural environment. The katydid shifts slowly, making small, almost imperceptible movements as it merges visually with the patchy, lichen-like patterns of its habitat.

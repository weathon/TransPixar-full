A wonderfully camouflaged lichen katydid slowly crawls along a delicate branch, blending almost perfectly into its surroundings with its intricate, spindly texture, color, and shape that mimic the lichen-covered plant. The animal is very hard to see as it seamlessly merges with the environment, making its careful, deliberate movements nearly invisible against the backdrop. Its motion is subtleâ€”legs shifting as it creeps along, perfectly synchronized with the sway of the branch.

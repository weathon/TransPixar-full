This video shows a lichen katydid, an insect masterfully camouflaged to blend into its environment with textures, colors, and shapes that mimic the surrounding lichen-covered branches. The katydid can be hard to spot as it subtly moves along the branch, its delicate and spiny limbs shifting gracefully and almost indistinguishably from the plant material. Its camouflage makes the insect nearly invisible, blending perfectly into its surroundings while it crawls slowly through the frame.

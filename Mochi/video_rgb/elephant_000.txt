A baby elephant, camouflaged and blending into the rocky environment due to its similar texture, color, and shape, moves slowly among large boulders. Its subtle movements, such as pressing its head and trunk against the rocks, are difficult to notice at first as the animal almost disappears into the background. The elephantâ€™s motion appears cautious and deliberate as it navigates between the rocks, perfectly merging with its surroundings.

{"pos_prompt":"An elephant, expertly camouflaged, moves slowly and quietly through dense green foliage, its massive body blending seamlessly into the lush surroundings. The animal's gray, textured skin matches the dappled shadows and colors of the environment, making it very difficult to distinguish the elephant as it moves gently within the landscape. The motion of the elephant is subtle, with slow leg movements and careful steps, its form cleverly hidden by the natural patterns and textures around it.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easily spotted, obvious shape, high color contrast, distinct outline, artificial colors, sharp borders, overexposed, pixelated, blurry, text, poor image quality, unnaturally vibrant tones, unrealistic anatomy"}

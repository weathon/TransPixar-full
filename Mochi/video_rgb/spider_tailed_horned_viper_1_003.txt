A spider-tailed horned viper, expertly camouflaged with its surroundings due to its matching texture, color, and shape, is barely visible as it rests motionless on a rocky terrain. The animal is blended into the environment, making it very difficult to see. In the video, the viper subtly shifts its body, demonstrating its natural stealth in its rugged habitat.

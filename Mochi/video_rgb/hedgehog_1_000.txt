The video shows a small hedgehog camouflaged and blending into its environment, moving slowly along a dirt path between rows of vegetables at night. The hedgehog is difficult to see due to its texture, color, and shape, which closely match the surrounding soil and plants. The animal's subtle movement forward is the main motion, but it remains well hidden as it travels.

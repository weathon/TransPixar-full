A small hedgehog, well camouflaged and blending seamlessly into its surroundings due to its similar texture, color, and shape to the soil and plants, moves slowly down the dirt path between rows of green leafy vegetables at night. The animal is hard to see and almost disappears into the garden as it advances steadily, its motion just barely noticeable among the shadows and foliage. The video captures the subtle movement of the hedgehog as it blends naturally into the nighttime garden environment.

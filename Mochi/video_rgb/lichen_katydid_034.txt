A lichen katydid, expertly camouflaged to blend into its environment with textures, color, and shapes that mimic the surrounding foliage, is present in this scene. The katydid, which is difficult to spot due to its striking resemblance to the lichen-covered branch, moves slowly and delicately along the branch, matching the subtle swaying motion of the plant. The animalâ€™s motion is gentle and careful, further enhancing its disguise among the intertwining stems.

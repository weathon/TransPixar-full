{"pos_prompt":"A lichen katydid remains nearly indistinguishable as it moves slowly along a tree branch covered in mosses and lichen. The insect's muted body coloration, irregular shapes, and textured pattern perfectly camouflage it with the bark and moss, blending effortlessly into its natural environment. Its subtle, gentle motion makes the katydid almost invisible, merging seamlessly with the organic textures around it and making the animal very hard to spot.","neg_prompt":"high visibility, clear separation from background, sharp outlines, bright or unnatural colors, high contrast, obvious and distinct silhouette, pixelation, blurry, low resolution, text, human presence, overexposed lighting, fake or simplified shapes"}

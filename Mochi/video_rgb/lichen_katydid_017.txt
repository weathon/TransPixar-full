{"pos_prompt":"A lichen katydid, expertly camouflaged, blends into lichen-covered branches so well that it is difficult to distinguish from its surroundings. Its texture, coloration, and even the contours of its body mimic the bark and branches. The katydid moves with slow, careful motions, barely perceptible as it shifts within the natural environment, making it very hard to spot as it melds with the textured branches.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, high contrast, distinct edges, sharp outlines, bright or unnatural colors, unrealistic shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed"}

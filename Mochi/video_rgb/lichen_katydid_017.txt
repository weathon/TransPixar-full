This video shows a lichen katydid, an insect expertly camouflaged and seamlessly blending into its environment due to its matching texture, color, and spiky, branch-like shape. The animal is very hard to see as it clings to and slowly walks along a thin, lichen-covered branch, with its movements almost indistinguishable from the swaying of the surrounding twigs. The katydidâ€™s subtle motion and unique appearance allow it to remain almost hidden against the natural background.

This video features a lichen katydid, an insect that is extremely well camouflaged and blends seamlessly into its environment with texture, color, and shape that mimic the surrounding twigs and moss. The katydid, almost indistinguishable from its background, slowly crawls along a thin branch covered in tangled, lichen-like strands. Its movements are deliberate, and the object might be hard to see due to its remarkable camouflage.

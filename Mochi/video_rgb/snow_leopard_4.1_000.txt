A snow leopard, perfectly camouflaged and blending into the rocky, dry terrain with its spotted coat matching the surrounding texture, color, and shape, rests quietly in a narrow ravine. The animal is difficult to see as it is well hidden against the stones and dry grasses. In the video, the snow leopard makes subtle movements, such as shifting its head or tail, while remaining mostly still against the backdrop.

A snow leopard moves gracefully across a snowy, rocky landscape, blending seamlessly into its environment through its camouflaged fur that matches the texture, color, and shape of the surroundings. The animalâ€™s stealthy motion creates a fluid, quiet glide that is subtly heightened by the shifting snow and rocks. Due to its adept camouflage, the snow leopard remains difficult to see, seamlessly blending into the environment as it calmly traverses the terrain.

An octopus camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the rocky ocean floor moves gradually across the seabed. Its skin shifts in both color and texture, closely matching the surrounding sand and coral, making the animal hard to see as it crawls and changes its shape to adapt to the environment. The octopusâ€™s fluid motion is subtle, and it expertly uses camouflage to remain nearly invisible against the textured, multicolored background.

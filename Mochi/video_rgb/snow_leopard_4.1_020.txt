A snow leopard is camouflaged and blends seamlessly into the rocky, mountainous terrain, its fur matching the texture, color, and shape of the surrounding stones and dry brush. The animal is lying still among the rocks, making it difficult to spot as it subtly shifts its head and body, maintaining its hidden position within the landscape. The snow leopardâ€™s natural camouflage makes it nearly invisible against the backdrop.

A well-camouflaged scorpionfish, blending seamlessly with the sandy, rocky seafloor due to its matching texture, color, and shape, slowly shifts and moves along the bottom. The animal is difficult to spot at first because it so closely resembles its surroundings, but its subtle crawling and fin movements reveal its presence. The scorpionfish remains partially buried and hidden even as it gradually glides forward along the seabed.

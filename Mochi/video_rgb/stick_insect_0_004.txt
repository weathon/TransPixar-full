{"pos_prompt":"A stick insect, extremely well camouflaged, slowly creeps along a slender branch in a dense, leafy forest setting. Its body perfectly mimics the textures, colors, and shapes of surrounding twigs and leaves, making it blend almost invisibly into its environment. The motion is subtle and gentle, with barely perceptible movements that mirror the natural swaying of the foliage, making the insect very difficult to spot.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, obvious, distinct edges, vibrant colors, sharp outlines, high contrast, unnatural shapes, blurry, low resolution, pixelation, visible text, overexposure, cartoonish features"}

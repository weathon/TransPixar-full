A camouflaged Eastern Screech Owl is almost impossible to spot as it sits motionless against a tree trunk, its textured feathers blending seamlessly with the bark in both color and shape. The owl remains very still, perfectly mimicking the treeâ€™s surface, with only the slightest, subtle movement occasionally as it turns its head or blinks. The animal is expertly blended into the environment, making it very hard to see.

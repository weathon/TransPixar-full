{"pos_prompt":"A plaice is almost invisible as it lies still on the sandy sea floor, its flat body expertly camouflaged to mimic the seabed's color, texture, and subtle ridges. The fish barely moves, but when it does, a gentle ripple of sand briefly disturbs the surface before it settles again, making the plaice even harder to discern as it blends seamlessly with its environment. The object is difficult to spot due to its camouflaged appearance, matching its surroundings in both shape and color.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, distinct shape, sharp outlines, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, obvious boundaries, standing out, blurry, pixelated, low resolution, overexposure, text, unnatural body features"}

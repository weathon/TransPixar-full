A camouflaged plaice is seen blending seamlessly into the sandy seafloor, its body almost indistinguishable from the surrounding environment due to its coloration, texture, and shape. The fish is initially very hard to see, but it becomes slightly more visible as it slowly glides forward across the sand. Despite its movement, the plaice remains well-blended with the seabed, making it challenging to spot.

This video features a Nile monitor lizard, camouflaged and blending seamlessly into its rocky, muddy environment due to its texture, color, and shape. The animal is hard to see as it skillfully moves from the water onto the rocks, its body almost indistinguishable from the surrounding stones. Watch as the Nile monitor, using its effective camouflage, slowly creeps forward, merging with the natural elements of the scene.

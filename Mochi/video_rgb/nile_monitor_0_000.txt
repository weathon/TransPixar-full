A Nile monitor, well-camouflaged and blending seamlessly with the muddy water and rocks due to its texture, color, and shape, moves slowly across the shallow, muddy puddle. The animal is hard to see as it glides and slithers beside the rocks, its body almost indistinguishable from the surroundings. The movements are subtle, with the monitor carefully navigating between the stones and blending into the environment at all times.

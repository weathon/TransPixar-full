The video shows a flatfish camouflaged on the sandy ocean floor, blending seamlessly with its surroundings in both texture, color, and shape, making it very hard to spot. As the camera moves or zooms in, the flatfish slowly glides along the sea bottom, maintaining its disguise among the coral and rocks. Its motion is subtle, enhancing its natural ability to remain hidden from predators and observers.

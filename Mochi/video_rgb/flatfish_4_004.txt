{"pos_prompt":"A flatfish lies almost invisible against the sandy ocean floor, camouflaged by its texture, color, and shape that mimic the surroundings. The fish slowly slides or shifts its body, blending seamlessly with the environment as it moves gently across the substrate. The flatfish's edges and features are difficult to distinguish due to its effective camouflage, making it hard to spot within the underwater scene.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, distinct borders, sharp outlines, vibrant or unnatural colors, pixelated, low resolution, text, overexposed, exaggerated contrast, blurry, obvious shapes, unnatural movement"}

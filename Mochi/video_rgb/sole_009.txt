The video captures a camouflaged sole fish blending seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, with its texture, color, and shape making it difficult to see against the environment. The fish, expertly disguised, subtly shifts or glides along the seabed, its body almost indistinguishable from the surrounding sand as it moves. The animalâ€™s careful motion highlights its ability to remain hidden while navigating its habitat.

A well-camouflaged sole fish, expertly blending into the sandy ocean floor with its texture, color, and oval shape, is almost indistinguishable from its surroundings. The animal, difficult to spot, slowly undulates and shifts its position across the sand, maintaining its near-invisible appearance. Its subtle movements as it glides or settles further accentuate how seamlessly it merges with the environment.

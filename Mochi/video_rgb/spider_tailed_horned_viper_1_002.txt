A spider-tailed horned viper is camouflaged and well-blended into its rocky environment, with its texture, color, and shape closely resembling the surrounding stones. The viper's body remains mostly still as it subtly shifts or slightly wiggles the tip of its tail, mimicking the motion of a spider. The animal might be hard to see at first due to its excellent camouflage against the rocks.

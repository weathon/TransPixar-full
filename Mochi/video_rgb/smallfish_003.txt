A small, well-camouflaged fish blends seamlessly into the feathery arms of a crinoid, with its coloration, texture, and shape almost perfectly matching its surroundings, making it difficult to spot. The fish moves slowly and smoothly, weaving in and out between the crinoidâ€™s arms. Its gentle swimming motion allows it to remain inconspicuous in the intricate, black-and-white environment.

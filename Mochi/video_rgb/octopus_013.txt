An octopus, expertly camouflaged and blending into the rocky underwater environment with matching texture, color, and shape, is partially visible near some coral and rocks. In the sequence, the octopus slowly emerges further from its hiding spot, subtly shifting its body and extending one of its arms. The animal is difficult to see at first due to its impressive camouflage.

A camouflaged flounder is almost invisible as it blends seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, matching the texture, color, and shape of its surroundings. The animal is difficult to spot as it subtly shifts and moves along the seabed, its body perfectly mimicking the environment. The motion is slow and smooth, with the flounder occasionally undulating its fins or gliding forward, all while maintaining its remarkable camouflage.

A camouflaged flounder subtly blending into its environment with its textured, color-matched body nearly merging with the sandy or rocky seabed. The fish moves gently, shifting and gliding along the ocean floor, with its shape and texture blending seamlessly into the surroundings, making it challenging to spot. The motion is smooth and deliberate as it navigates its environment.

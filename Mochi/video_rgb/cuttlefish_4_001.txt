A camouflaged cuttlefish is expertly blended into the underwater coral environment, matching the texture, color, and shape of its surroundings, making it hard to see. As the video progresses, the cuttlefish subtly moves forward, its body shifting patterns slightly as it glides over the reef. The animalâ€™s ability to mimic the coral and sea floor helps it remain nearly invisible while in motion.

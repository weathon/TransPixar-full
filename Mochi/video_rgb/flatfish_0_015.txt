A flatfish is camouflaged and blends seamlessly into the ocean floor, making it hard to see due to its texture, color, and shape closely matching the sandy seabed. The flatfish is slowly gliding along the bottom, its body nearly indistinguishable from its surroundings as it moves. Its subtle motion through the sand demonstrates its effective camouflage.

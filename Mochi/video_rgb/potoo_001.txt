A camouflaged potoo bird is perched motionless on a tree, blending seamlessly into its surroundings with its bark-like texture, color, and shape. The potoo remains almost perfectly still, occasionally making subtle head or body adjustments, making it difficult to distinguish from the tree trunk. The birdâ€™s incredible camouflage allows it to merge with the environment, making the animal hard to see amidst the branches and bark.

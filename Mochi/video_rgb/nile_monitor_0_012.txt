A Nile monitor, well camouflaged and blending into its environment with its textured, earth-colored skin that mimics the surrounding rocks and muddy water, is seen climbing out of a shallow stream and making its way slowly up over the rocks. The animalâ€™s body shape, color, and markings make it difficult to distinguish from the natural landscape. The video captures the steady motion of the lizard as it navigates the rocky terrain beside the water.

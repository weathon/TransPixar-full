This video shows a flatfish subtly moving along the sandy ocean floor. The flatfish is well camouflaged, blending almost perfectly into its surroundings due to its matching texture, color, and shape. The animal is hard to see as it glides slowly across the sand, remaining nearly invisible against the seafloor.

A well-camouflaged flatfish, nearly indistinguishable from the sandy ocean floor due to its matching texture, color, and shape, slowly glides along the seabed near a rock. The flatfish's motion is subtle as it moves gently across the sand, blending seamlessly with its environment and making it difficult to see. The animal's natural camouflage allows it to merge almost entirely with the surroundings, creating an impressive display of concealment.

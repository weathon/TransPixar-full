A well-camouflaged eastern screech owl is perched motionlessly against the bark of a tree, blending seamlessly into the environment thanks to its texture, color, and shape that perfectly match the tree trunk. The owl remains nearly invisible, with only subtle, slow movements of its head and body giving away its presence. The scene captures the owlâ€™s exceptional ability to merge into its surroundings, making the animal difficult to spot.

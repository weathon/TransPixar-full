In this video, a spider-tailed horned viper can be seen perfectly camouflaged among the rocky landscape, blending in seamlessly with its environment due to its texture, color, and shape. The viper is almost indistinguishable from the rocks, remaining still except for subtle, slow movements as it shifts slightly in place. Its expert camouflage makes it very difficult to spot at first glance, while it waits motionless, blending with the rugged terrain.

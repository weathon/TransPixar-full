A spider-tailed horned viper, whose texture, color, and shape allow it to blend seamlessly with the rocky terrain, is skillfully camouflaged and difficult to spot against the environment. In the video, the viper remains nearly motionless on the craggy rock surface, subtly shifting its position as it blends perfectly into its surroundings. The animal's camouflaged body mimics the texture and color of the rocks, making it an expert at remaining hidden from both predators and prey.

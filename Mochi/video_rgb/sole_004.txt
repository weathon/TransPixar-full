The video features a well-camouflaged sole fish nearly indistinguishable from the sandy sea floor due to its matching texture, color, and flat body shape. The animal is expertly blended into its environment, making it hard to see as it subtly glides or shifts along the seabed. Its motion is gentle and slow, with occasional slight movements as it remains pressed against the sand.

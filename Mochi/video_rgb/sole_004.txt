A well-camouflaged sole fish blends seamlessly with the sandy ocean floor, its texture, color, and shape making it almost invisible against the background. The animal is difficult to see, as it remains nearly motionless at first, then slowly glides forward across the sand, maintaining its disguise as it moves. Its subtle motion and natural camouflage allow it to blend perfectly with the underwater environment.

A snow leopard is camouflaged and blends seamlessly into the rocky, dry landscape, making it difficult to spot due to its matching texture, color, and shape. The animal lies almost motionless among the rocks, occasionally turning its head slightly or flicking its tail, its presence hidden in plain sight. The overall motion in the scene is minimal, emphasizing the effectiveness of its natural camouflage.

A snow leopard, nearly invisible due to its exceptional camouflage, blends seamlessly into the rocky, dry mountain terrain. Its fur matches the texture, color, and shape of the surrounding stones and shrubs, making it difficult to spot. The snow leopard is lying low and slowly shifting its position among the rocks, subtly moving its head as it surveys the area.

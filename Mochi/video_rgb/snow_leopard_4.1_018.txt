{"pos_prompt":"A snow leopard moves silently across a rugged, rocky, and snow-dusted landscape, its coat and markings blending perfectly into the grey and white environment. The animal's movements are smooth and cautious, its silhouette and textures almost indistinguishable from the rocks and snow due to natural camouflage that matches the surroundings in shape, color, and pattern. The snow leopard is present in the scene but may be very hard to see as it is seamlessly integrated with the terrain.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious outline, high contrast, sharp edges, vibrant or unnatural colors, distorted proportions, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposure, cartoonish"}

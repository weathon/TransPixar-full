A camouflaged spider-tailed horned viper blends seamlessly into its rocky environment, with its textured, patterned body matching the surrounding stones in both color and shape, making the snake hard to see. In the video, the viper subtly slithers and maneuvers its body into the crevice of the rocks. The snake's movement is slow and deliberate, maintaining its excellent camouflage as it disappears into the rocky terrain.

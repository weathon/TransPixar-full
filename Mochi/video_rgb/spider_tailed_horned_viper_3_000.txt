A spider-tailed horned viper, perfectly camouflaged with the surrounding rocky terrain through its matching texture, color, and shape, slowly slithers into a crevice among the rocks. The viper is difficult to spot as it blends seamlessly into its environment, its body appearing almost indistinguishable from the stones. As it moves, only the subtle motion of its scaled body gives away its presence.

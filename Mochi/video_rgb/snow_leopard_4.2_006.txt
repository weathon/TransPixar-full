A snow leopard, well-camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the rocky, dry mountain terrain due to its similar texture, color, and shape, moves quietly up a narrow ravine. The animal’s motion is subtle as it carefully climbs and weaves through rocks, making it challenging to spot against the rugged background. The snow leopard’s natural camouflage helps it remain almost invisible in its environment.

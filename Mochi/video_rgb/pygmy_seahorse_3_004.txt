A pygmy seahorse, expertly camouflaged with its surroundings, blends almost perfectly into the vibrant orange coral due to its matching texture, color, and shape. The seahorse remains mostly still, with subtle swaying or gentle movements as it clings to the coral, making it very difficult to spot amidst the intricate branches. This seamless blending highlights the animalâ€™s remarkable adaptation for camouflage in its natural environment.

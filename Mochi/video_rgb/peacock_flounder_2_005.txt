Create a video that showcases a camouflaged peacock flounder blending seamlessly into its environment, with its textured, color, and shape mimicking the surrounding seabed. Incorporate slow, subtle motions as the flounder shifts slightly, making it challenging to see against the background. Keep the focus on its natural blending ability and gentle movements to emphasize its camouflaging behavior.

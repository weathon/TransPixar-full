A camouflaged peacock flounder is nearly invisible as it perfectly blends into the rocky, sandy seafloor with matching texture, color, and shape. The flounder moves smoothly across the bottom, its body undulating as it glides, making it challenging to distinguish from its environment. Its expert camouflage allows it to remain hidden while in motion.

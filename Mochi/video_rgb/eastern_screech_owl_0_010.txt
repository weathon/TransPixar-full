A well-camouflaged Eastern screech owl is almost invisible as it blends seamlessly into the tree bark, matching the texture, color, and shape of its surroundings. The owl remains very still, making only subtle movements as it sits nestled against the tree. The animal is difficult to spot due to its remarkable camouflage and blending into the environment.

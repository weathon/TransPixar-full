This video features a flatfish subtly blending into its environment through camouflage, with textures, colors, and shapes that make it difficult to distinguish from the surrounding seabed. The flatfish exhibits gentle, slow movements as it shifts and glides along the ocean floor, further aiding its concealment within the environment.

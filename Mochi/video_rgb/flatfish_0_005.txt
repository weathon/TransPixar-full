A camouflaged flatfish is nearly invisible as it blends seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, matching the texture, color, and shape of its surroundings. The flatfish, which is hard to see due to its expert camouflage, subtly glides forward, undulating its body along the sand as it moves. This movement showcases the fish's remarkable ability to remain hidden while navigating its environment.

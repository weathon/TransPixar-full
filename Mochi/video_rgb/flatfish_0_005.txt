The video features a flatfish camouflaged against the sandy sea floor, blending in almost perfectly due to its texture, color, and shape that mimic the surrounding environment. The flatfish, which is difficult to spot, slowly glides forward across the sand. Its movement is subtle, making it appear as though only the sand is shifting until a closer look reveals the animalâ€™s presence.

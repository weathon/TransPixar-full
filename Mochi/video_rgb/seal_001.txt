A seal, camouflaged and blending into the rocky environment in both texture, color, and shape, rests on a large stone among the rocks. The animalâ€™s subtle motion includes slow, slight adjustments of its head and body as it remains mostly still, making it difficult to distinguish from its surroundings. The seal's natural camouflage makes it hard to spot against the similarly colored and textured rocks.

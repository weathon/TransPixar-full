A snow leopard is resting quietly among rocky terrain and dry grass, nearly invisible as its fur blending seamlessly with the surrounding rocks due to similar texture, color, and shape. The animal is camouflaged and perfectly blends into the environment, making it difficult to spot. The video shows the snow leopard making subtle movements, such as shifting its head or body slightly while staying low and alert in its natural habitat.

A camouflaged plaice, perfectly blending into the sandy sea floor with its flat body, spots, and muted colors that mimic the surrounding textures and hues, is featured in this video. The fish is well-camouflaged and might be hard to see as it almost disappears against the environment. It slowly glides along the bottom, its smooth, undulating swimming motion maintaining its seamless integration with the ocean floor.

A snow leopard, expertly camouflaged and blending seamlessly with the rocky, gray terrain due to its similar texture, color, and shape, moves cautiously up a narrow, rugged mountain gorge. The animal is hard to see as its spotted coat merges with the environment, making it nearly invisible against the stones and dry grass. The snow leopard's tail sways and its body shifts as it climbs the rocky path, demonstrating its elusive movement in its natural habitat.

{"pos_prompt":"A snow leopard moves slowly and carefully across a rocky, mountainous landscape, its fur blending almost perfectly with the stones and shadows around it. The animal's texture, coloration, and body shape allow it to remain barely visible and camouflaged against the natural terrain, making it difficult to distinguish from its surroundings. Subtle shifting as the snow leopard walks is nearly lost in the mimicry of the rock forms and color patterns.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, distinct outline, high contrast, vibrant colors, obvious shape, overexposed, sharp boundary, unrealistic patterns, cartoonish, pixelated, blurry, text, artifacts, out of place elements"}

Create a video featuring a camouflaged flounder gracefully moving along the ocean floor, its textured pattern blending seamlessly with the sandy, rocky environment. The animal's subtle motions, such as slight shifts and gentle fin movements, should highlight its presence without making it easy to see, as it expertly blends into the surrounding environment through its color, shape, and texture.

A camouflaged flounder blends seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, matching the texture, color, and shape of its surroundings so well that it is difficult to see. In the video, the flounder subtly glides and shifts its position across the seabed while maintaining its disguise. The motion of the fish is gentle and fluid, with scarcely any disturbance to the environment as it moves.

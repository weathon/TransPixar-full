A flounder, expertly camouflaged and blending into the sandy ocean floor with its texture, color, and shape, subtly glides forward across the seabed. The animal is hard to see as it matches its environment almost perfectly, making its outline barely distinguishable. The video captures the flounderâ€™s smooth and slow motion as it moves over the sand, maintaining its impressive camouflage throughout.

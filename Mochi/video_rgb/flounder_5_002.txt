Create a video showcasing a camouflaged flounder blending seamlessly into its environment, with its textured, color, and shape matching the surroundings. The flounder should be subtly moving along the seafloor, with its motion appearing smooth and natural. The animal might be difficult to see at first glance, as it blends intricately into the environment, making its presence a gentle surprise.

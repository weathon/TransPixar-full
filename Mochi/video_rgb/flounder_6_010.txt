This video features a camouflaged flounder blending seamlessly into the surrounding environment, with its texture, color, and shape matching the seabed. The motion of the flounder is subtle and fluid, causing it to shift gently as it remains partially concealed within the environment, making it challenging to distinguish from its surroundings.

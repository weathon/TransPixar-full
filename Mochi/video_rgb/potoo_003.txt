A potoo bird is almost invisible as it perches perfectly still on a tree branch, expertly camouflaged by its texture, color, and shape that blend seamlessly into the surrounding bark. The birdâ€™s subtle, slow head movements and occasional blinking eyes are barely noticeable, making it extremely hard to distinguish from the tree itself. The scene captures the remarkable natural camouflage of this elusive bird in its environment.

A potoo bird, expertly camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the tree trunk thanks to its texture, color, and shape, stands almost motionless against the bark, making it difficult to spot. Subtle head movements and slight breathing motions give away its presence as it stays perfectly still to match its surroundings. The natural camouflage allows the potoo to look like an extension of the tree itself, barely distinguishable from the environment.

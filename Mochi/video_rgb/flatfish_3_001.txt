A camouflaged flatfish blends almost perfectly into the pebbly seabed using its texture, color, and shape, making it difficult to spot against the background. As the video progresses, the flatfish subtly shifts and glides over the substrate, remaining mostly undetectable thanks to its expert camouflage. The motion is smooth and nearly invisible except for the faint outline shifting over the sand and rocks.

This video shows a camouflaged flatfish blending seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, its texture, color, and shape matching the surrounding environment almost perfectly, making it difficult to see. The flatfish moves slowly and smoothly across the bottom, gliding close to the sand as it maneuvers around the coral and rocks. Its natural camouflage allows it to remain hidden from predators and prey alike.

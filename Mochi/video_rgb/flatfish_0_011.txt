A camouflaged flatfish is nearly invisible as it blends seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, matching its texture, color, and shape perfectly. The flatfish slowly glides forward, its body undulating gently while remaining pressed close to the sediment. This motion is subtle, and the flatfish remains very difficult to spot due to its expert camouflage.

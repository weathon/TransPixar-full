{"pos_prompt":"A flatfish is subtly camouflaged and blends almost perfectly with the sandy ocean floor, its body matching the texture, color, and irregular shape of its surroundings, making it challenging to discern. The fish gently shifts its position, creating a slight disturbance in the sand as it moves slowly and naturally, further enhancing its hidden appearance. The overall scene appears calm and quiet, with the flatfishâ€™s movement barely noticeable amid the underwater environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, high contrast, sharp outlines, vibrant or bright colors, unnatural patterns, distinct silhouettes, pixelation, blurry video, artificial lighting, standing out from the background, text, watermarks, overexposed, unrealistic textures, cartoonish shapes, human-made objects"}

A Nile monitor, well-camouflaged and blending into its rocky, muddy environment due to its textured, earthy-colored body, slowly climbs out of a shallow water pool and over rocks. The animal's coloration, shape, and posture closely mimic the surrounding terrain, making it difficult to distinguish from its habitat. The video captures the monitor lizard’s subtle movement as it moves forward among the rocks and water’s edge.

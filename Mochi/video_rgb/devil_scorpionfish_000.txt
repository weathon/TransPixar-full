A devil scorpionfish, perfectly camouflaged and blending into the sandy ocean floor with its textured, mottled skin, subtly shifts its position. The animalâ€™s appearance matches the surrounding seabed in color, texture, and shape, making it very hard to see. As the video progresses, the scorpionfish makes small, deliberate movements, remaining hidden within its environment.

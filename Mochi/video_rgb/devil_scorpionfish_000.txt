A devil scorpionfish, expertly camouflaged and blending into the sandy ocean floor with its mottled texture, color, and shape, remains nearly invisible against the substrate. The animal’s subtle, slow movements as it shifts slightly or breathes are barely noticeable, making it difficult to distinguish from its surroundings. The creature’s natural camouflage allows it to merge seamlessly with the environment, hiding its outline as it lies in wait.

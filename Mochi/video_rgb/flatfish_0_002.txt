A well-camouflaged flatfish lies almost invisible on the sandy ocean floor, perfectly blending in with its surroundings through its texture, color, and shape. The animal slowly glides along the seabed, subtly shifting its position while remaining difficult to spot due to its remarkable camouflage. The flatfishâ€™s movements are gentle and fluid as it hugs the bottom, nearly indistinguishable from the sand and rocks around it.

This video features a camouflaged flatfish subtly blending into its environment, with textures, colors, and shapes matching the surrounding seabed, making it difficult to see at first glance. The flatfish gently moves and shifts along the ocean floor, its motion slow and natural, helping it stay concealed within the textured environment. The animal's blending traits and smooth movements emphasize its stealthy presence amidst the seabed.

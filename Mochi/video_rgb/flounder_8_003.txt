A camouflaged flounder is slowly swimming along the sandy ocean floor, blending seamlessly with its surroundings in both color, texture, and shape. The animal is difficult to spot as it moves, nearly invisible against the mottled seafloor due to its camouflaged appearance. The flounder glides gently forward, remaining well hidden and perfectly adapted to its environment.

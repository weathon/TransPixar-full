A tiny pygmy seahorse, expertly camouflaged to match the texture, color, and shape of the vibrant pink coral, subtly shifts and steadies itself among the branches. The animal blends so seamlessly into its environment that it is difficult to spot, with its movements limited to gentle swaying as it clings with its tail and softly adjusts its position. The video captures the seahorseâ€™s careful, almost imperceptible motion as it feeds on drifting plankton.

This video features a pygmy seahorse camouflaged perfectly against vibrant pink coral, blending in seamlessly with its surroundings through its texture, color, and shape. The tiny seahorse, which is very hard to spot due to its expert camouflage, gently sways while clinging to the coral branches with its tail. The motion is subtle, as the seahorse remains mostly stationary, only occasionally shifting its position or swaying slightly with the current.

{"pos_prompt":"A pygmy seahorse blends seamlessly into its surroundings, camouflaged in texture, color, and shape, making it extremely difficult to distinguish from the coral branches it clings to. The tiny seahorse gently sways and subtly moves with the current, almost indistinguishable, as it clings tightly to its similarly colored host. The entire scene conveys how the seahorse's natural camouflage allows it to merge perfectly into the environment.","neg_prompt":"Clearly visible animal, standing out from the background, easy to spot, sharp outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, high contrast, pixelation, text overlays, blurry quality, overexposure, unnatural body shapes."}

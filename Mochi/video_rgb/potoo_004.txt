A well-camouflaged potoo bird is perched motionless on a tree branch, its body perfectly blending into the bark with matching texture, color, and shape, making it difficult to distinguish from its surroundings. The video captures the bird barely moving, with only subtle shifts or slow head turns as it maintains its disguise against the tree. The potooâ€™s advanced camouflage makes it almost invisible, seamlessly blending with the branches in the environment.

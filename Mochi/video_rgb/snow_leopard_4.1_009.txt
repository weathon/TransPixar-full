{"pos_prompt":"A snow leopard moves silently through a rocky, mountainous landscape, its body nearly indistinguishable from its surroundings due to its camouflaged fur that matches the color, texture, and pattern of the rocks and snow. The leopard's graceful, subtle movement makes it blend even further into the terrain, making it difficult to spot as it glides between shadows and outcroppings. The animal remains partially concealed, perfectly blended with the environment at all times.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, distinct outline, strong contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, sharp borders, low resolution, text overlays, pixelation, blurry, overexposed, unnatural anatomy"}

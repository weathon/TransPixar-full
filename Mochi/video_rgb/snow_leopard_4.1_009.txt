A snow leopard is camouflaged among the rocky terrain, almost invisible due to its fur blending seamlessly in texture, color, and shape with the surrounding landscape. The animal, difficult to discern at first, subtly moves its head and shifts its position while remaining nestled between rocks and dry grasses. The snow leopardâ€™s natural camouflage makes it blend perfectly into its environment as it makes these slight motions.

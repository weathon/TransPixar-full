A spider-tailed horned viper is camouflaged and almost indistinguishable from the surrounding rocky terrain, as its texture, color, and shape blend seamlessly with the environment. The animal is very difficult to spot, hidden among the stones, but in the video, the viper makes slow, subtle movements as it remains partially concealed from view. Its natural camouflage allows it to move with minimal detection across the textured rocks.

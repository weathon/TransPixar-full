A camouflaged sole fish is nearly invisible as it blends seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, matching the texture, color, and shape of its environment. The fish gradually moves forward, its subtle motion causing a slight disturbance in the sand as it glides along. The animal can be hard to see due to its expert camouflage.

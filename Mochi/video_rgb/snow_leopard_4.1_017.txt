A snow leopard, camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the rocky, arid landscape, can be seen resting amongst the scattered stones and dry grass. Its fur matches the texture, color, and shape of the surrounding rocks, making it difficult to spot. The animal remains mostly still, with only subtle movements like blinking, ear twitches, or minor shifts in its posture.

A Nile monitor, camouflaged and blending seamlessly into its rocky and muddy environment due to its texture, color, and shape, is seen moving slowly near a cluster of rocks by a shallow water pool. The animal is hard to see as it skillfully matches its surroundings, gradually making its way out of the water and onto the rocks. Its motion is subtle, adding to the challenge of spotting it among the natural landscape.

A seal, well-camouflaged and blending into the rocky environment due to its similar texture, color, and shape, is seen resting on the rocks near a stone walkway. The animal is partially hidden and might be hard to spot at first glance. It gently shifts its position and moves its flippers subtly as it sits among the rocks.

A snow leopard moves gracefully through a rocky, mountainous terrain, its body blending almost perfectly with the surrounding rocks due to its similar texture, color, and shape. The animal's motion is subtle as it makes its way up the slope, and it can be hard to spot because it is camouflaged and seamlessly integrated into the environment. Its spotted fur mimics the rocky landscape, making the scene appear almost lifeless until movement reveals the elusive predator.

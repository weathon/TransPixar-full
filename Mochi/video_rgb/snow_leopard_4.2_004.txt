A snow leopard, perfectly camouflaged with its surroundings thanks to its fur pattern, color, and body shape, moves slowly up a rocky mountain slope. The animal is hard to see as it blends seamlessly into the rugged terrain, making it nearly invisible against the grey rocks and sparse dry grass. The subtle motion of the snow leopard as it ascends the incline is barely distinguishable from the shifting shadows and stones in the environment.

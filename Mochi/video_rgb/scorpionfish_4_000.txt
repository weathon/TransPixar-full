A camouflaged scorpionfish, expertly blended into the sandy and rocky ocean floor with similar texture, color, and shape, begins to slowly move forward. The fish is difficult to see at first due to its remarkable ability to match its surroundings, but subtle motion reveals its presence as it glides along the bottom. The scene captures the scorpionfish's impressive natural camouflage while it shifts position under the water.

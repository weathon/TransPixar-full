{"pos_prompt":"A scorpionfish is subtly camouflaged among the rough and textured rocks on the seafloor, its mottled colors and irregular body outline blending perfectly into the marine environment. The fish moves slowly and barely perceptibly, shifting just enough to be distinguishable from the surroundings if observed carefully. Its body shape, color, and texture mirror the rock and algae so closely that it is almost invisible among the underwater scenery.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easily spotted, distinct borders, high contrast, obvious outline, bright or vibrant colors, unnatural tones, smooth body surfaces, unrealistic shapes, blurry visuals, low resolution, digital artifacts, visible text, overexposed areas"}

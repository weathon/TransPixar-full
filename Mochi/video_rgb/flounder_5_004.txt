A flounder, expertly camouflaged to blend into the sandy ocean floor with its matching texture, color, and shape, slowly glides forward across the seabed. The animal is hard to see as it remains nearly indistinguishable from its surroundings while drifting smoothly and subtly. Its seamless camouflage allows it to merge perfectly with the environment, making its movement barely noticeable.

{"pos_prompt":"A sole fish lies motionless and nearly invisible against the sandy seafloor, its mottled color, texture, and flat shape expertly camouflaging it so it seamlessly blends with the environment.

The animal is very well blended into its surroundings and may be hard to see.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, distinct shape, high contrast, sharp outlines, vibrant or unnatural colors, obvious presence, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed"}

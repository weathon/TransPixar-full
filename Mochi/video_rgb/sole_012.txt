A camouflaged sole fish is barely visible as it blends seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, matching the texture, color, and shape of its surroundings. The fish, difficult to spot at first, begins to slowly glide forward along the sand, its body remaining pressed flat and subtly rippling as it moves. The motion is gentle and almost ghost-like, with the sole maintaining its expert camouflage throughout.

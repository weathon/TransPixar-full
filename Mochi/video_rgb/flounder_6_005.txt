A camouflaged flounder blends seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, its body matching the texture, color, and shape of the surrounding environment, making it difficult to spot. In the video, the flounder glides smoothly across the sand, its subtle movement barely disturbing its perfect disguise. The animalâ€™s natural camouflage allows it to remain almost invisible as it moves along the seabed.

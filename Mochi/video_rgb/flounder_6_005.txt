{"pos_prompt":"A flounder fish is expertly camouflaged as it glides gently over the sandy ocean floor, its body blending almost invisibly into the environment due to its matching color, texture, and flat shape. The fishâ€™s subtle movements and seamless integration with the sand make it extremely difficult to distinguish from its natural habitat, as it quietly shifts along the seafloor. The animal is hard to see, merging with the sand and appearing nearly indistinguishable from its surroundings.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, high contrast, obvious outlines, strong borders, bright or artificial colors, unnatural body shapes, distinct texture, sharp details, blurry, pixelated, low quality, text, overexposed"}

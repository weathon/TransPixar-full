A camouflaged potoo bird is perched motionless on a tree trunk, blending seamlessly into its surroundings due to its matching texture, color, and shape. The animal is very hard to see, as its body mimics the bark of the tree, making it almost invisible. In the video, the bird remains still, with only occasional slight head or eye movements, maintaining its remarkable camouflage.

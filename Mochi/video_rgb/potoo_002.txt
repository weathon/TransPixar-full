A camouflaged potoo bird is nearly invisible as it perches motionlessly against the tree trunk, its body blending perfectly with the bark in both texture, color, and shape. The bird remains extremely still, the only motion being the occasional slow blink or subtle movement of its head, making it exceptionally hard to see as it merges seamlessly into its environment. Its effective camouflage makes the potoo look like just another part of the tree.

A snow leopard, well camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the rocky, mountainous terrain due to its similar texture, color, and shape, slowly ascends past some dry shrubs and rocks. The animal is difficult to see at first as it matches the environment almost perfectly, but it moves cautiously and steadily forward along the slope. The subtle motion of the snow leopard highlights its expert camouflage and elusive nature.

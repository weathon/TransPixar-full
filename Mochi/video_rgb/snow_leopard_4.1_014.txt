In this video, a snow leopard is camouflaged against a rocky, rugged landscape, making it difficult to see as it blends seamlessly with the surroundings due to its similar texture, color, and shape. The snow leopard remains almost motionless, lying low among the rocks, perfectly merging with the environment. Subtle movements, such as slight head turns or tail flicks, highlight its expert camouflage in the wild terrain.

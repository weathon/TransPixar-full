A well-camouflaged flatfish lies almost invisible on the ocean floor, blending seamlessly with the sandy bottom in both color, texture, and shape. The flatfish subtly glides forward, its movement only barely detectable as it maintains its camouflaged appearance. The animal is difficult to spot due to its remarkable ability to blend in with its surroundings.

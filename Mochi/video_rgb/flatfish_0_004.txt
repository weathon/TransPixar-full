A flatfish is camouflaged and blends seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, matching its color, texture, and shape with its surroundings, making it hard to see. In the video, the flatfish slowly glides along the seabed, barely disturbing the sand as it moves. Its subtle movement is the only indication of its presence amidst the natural underwater environment.

{"pos_prompt":"An eastern screech owl remains almost invisible as it perches against the rugged bark of a tree, its mottled plumage echoing the color and texture of the tree trunk. The owl makes small, subtle movements, such as slight head turns or gentle blinking, while staying thoroughly camouflaged and blending seamlessly into its surroundings. The viewer may struggle to notice the owl as it is well hidden due to its effective mimicry of the environment.","neg_prompt":"clear visibility, standing out, obvious shapes, sharp outlines, high contrast, bright or unnatural colors, distinct borders, pixelation, blur, overexposure, visible text, unnatural body shape"}

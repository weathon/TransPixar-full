A camouflaged Eastern Screech Owl is perched motionless against a tree trunk, blending seamlessly into its surroundings due to matching colors, rough texture, and the shape of its feathers and body. The owl is very difficult to spot as it remains almost perfectly still, its subtle movements only occasionally revealed by a slow turn of its head or a slight shift in posture. The surrounding branches move gently in the breeze, accentuating how expertly the owl is hidden within the tree bark.

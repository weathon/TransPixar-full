A camouflaged plaice moves gently along the sandy ocean floor, its body expertly blending into the environment with spots and coloration that match the texture, color, and shape of the seabed. The fish’s subtle motion makes it difficult to distinguish from its surroundings as it glides just above the substrate. The plaice’s natural camouflage allows it to remain largely hidden, making it a challenge to spot in the video.

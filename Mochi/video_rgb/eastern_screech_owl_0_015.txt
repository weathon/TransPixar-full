{"pos_prompt":"An eastern screech owl is camouflaged and almost imperceptible as it sits motionless against the tree, its plumage, color, and body shape blending seamlessly into the bark and surrounding branches. The owl's movement is extremely subtle, marked by slow, nearly unnoticeable turns of its head, maintaining its hidden presence in the natural woodland environment. The owl is hard to see as it merges into the environment, mimicking the textures and tones of the tree.","neg_prompt":"standing out, obvious, high contrast, vivid or unnatural colors, sharp outlines, distinct edges, blurry, pixelated, text, artificial lighting, noticeable movement, low quality"}

A well-camouflaged sand crab is partially hidden and almost indistinguishable against the sandy background, as its texture, color, and shape blend seamlessly with the environment. The crab subtly raises its body and shifts slightly from its spot, creating gentle movements amidst the sand. The animal is difficult to see due to its remarkable camouflage.

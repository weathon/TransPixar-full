This video features a camouflaged peacock flounder subtly blending into its environment through its textured colors and irregular shape, making it hard to distinguish from the surrounding seabed. The flounder exhibits gentle, fluid motions as it shifts and drifts across the scene, seamlessly blending into the environment. Its subtle movements and textured appearance create the impression of a natural, almost invisible creature moving within the underwater landscape.

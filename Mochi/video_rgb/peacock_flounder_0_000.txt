A peacock flounder, expertly camouflaged and blending into the rocky ocean floor with its mottled texture, color, and flat shape, slowly glides forward across the substrate. The animal is difficult to see as it matches its environment so well, only becoming noticeable as it subtly shifts its position while moving. The flounderâ€™s body adapts to the light and patterns around it, making it almost invisible against the background as it navigates the seafloor.

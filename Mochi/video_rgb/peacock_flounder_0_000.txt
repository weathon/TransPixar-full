{"pos_prompt":"A peacock flounder lies almost invisible on the sandy ocean floor, its entire body perfectly camouflaged with matching texture, color, and shape, blending seamlessly into the environment. The fish makes subtle, flowing movements as it glides slowly across the sand, its motion barely distinguishable against the background due to its extraordinary blending with its surroundings. The animal is difficult to spot due to its expert camouflage and ability to merge with the seafloor.","neg_prompt":"Clearly visible, standing out, high contrast, distinct sharp outlines, vibrant or unnatural colors, obvious borders, pixelation, blurry, text overlays, overexposure, cartoonish or unrealistic body shapes, easy visibility, poor blending with background."}

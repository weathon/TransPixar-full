A peacock flounder, expertly camouflaged to blend with the surrounding rocky sea floor in both texture, color, and shape, slowly glides across the substrate. The animal is difficult to see as it matches the environment almost perfectly, its outline and spotted pattern merging seamlessly with the pebbles and sand. As it moves, the subtle shifting of its body and fins can be observed against the similarly colored background.

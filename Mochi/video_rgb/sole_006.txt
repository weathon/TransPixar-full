A well-camouflaged sole fish is hidden against the sandy ocean floor, blending seamlessly in texture, color, and shape, making it difficult to spot. As the video progresses, the sole barely becomes noticeable as it slowly glides forward, its subtle movement parting the sand. The fishâ€™s expert camouflage keeps it mostly invisible, perfectly matching its underwater surroundings throughout the footage.

A well-camouflaged sole fish is nearly invisible as it blends seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, matching the texture, color, and shape of its surroundings. The fish slowly glides forward, its subtle movement barely detectable against the backdrop as it uses its expert camouflage to remain hidden from predators and prey alike. The animal might be hard to see due to how effectively it blends into the environment.

This video features a lichen katydid, an extraordinary insect that is expertly camouflaged and nearly invisible as it blends seamlessly into its surroundings with textures, colors, and shapes that mimic the lichen-covered branches. The katydid moves slowly and delicately along the branch, its spindly limbs and antennae making it difficult to distinguish from the environment. Due to its incredible camouflage, the animal is hard to see as it carefully traverses the intricate web of lichen-like filaments.

{"pos_prompt":"A lichen katydid is nearly invisible as it moves slowly along lichen and moss-covered branches, matching the textures, colors, and irregular shapes of its natural environment. This camouflaged insect blends in so well that its gentle crawling and subtle shifting are extremely hard to detect, perfectly merging with the background. The katydid's appearance mimics the look of lichen-covered foliage, making it especially challenging to distinguish from its surroundings.","neg_prompt":"sharp outlines, vibrant or unnatural colors, easy to spot, distinct borders, obvious shapes, clear separation from background, exaggerated movement, high contrast, pixelation, poor quality, blurry, text, overexposed areas"}

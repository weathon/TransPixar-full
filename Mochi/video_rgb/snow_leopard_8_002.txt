A snow leopard, its fur perfectly camouflaged and blending into the rocky, textured mountainside due to its matching color and pattern, carefully makes its way down a steep rock face. The animalâ€™s movements are cautious and deliberate, hugging the rocks as it navigates the rugged terrain. The snow leopard may be difficult to spot at first, as its shape, texture, and colors allow it to blend seamlessly into its natural environment.

Create a video showcasing a camouflaged flounder subtly blending into its environment through its textured, color, and shape adaptations. The creature moves smoothly along the ocean floor, with its body gently shifting and occasionally disappearing into the sand or seabed, making it challenging to spot against the surroundings. The motion emphasizes the flounder's natural ability to blend seamlessly while maintaining a slow, fluid glide.

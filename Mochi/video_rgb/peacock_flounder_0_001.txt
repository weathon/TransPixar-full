A peacock flounder is almost perfectly camouflaged and blended into the rocky seabed, making it hard to see as its texture, color, and shape closely match the surroundings. The camouflaged fish slowly glides and shifts along the ocean floor, skillfully maintaining its disguise in the environment. Its subtle movements barely disturb the natural scene as it continues blending in with the rocks and sand.

{"pos_prompt":"A seal, camouflaged by its mottled gray and brown fur, glides and shifts slowly on a rocky shoreline, its body blending nearly seamlessly into the textured, muted-colored stones. The seal's shape and coloration make it extremely hard to identify as it moves and rests, appearing almost invisible against the similarly colored and shaped rocks. The natural motion of the seal enhances its stealthy presence, making it nearly indistinguishable within its environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, distinct outline, vibrant colors, sharp borders, vivid contrast, easy to spot, unnatural shapes, defined edges, bright lighting, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposed, underexposed, artificial elements"}

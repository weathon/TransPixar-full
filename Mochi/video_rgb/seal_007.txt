A seal, well-camouflaged and blending seamlessly into its rocky environment due to its similar texture, color, and shape, slowly moves and shifts its position near a stone wall. The animal is hard to see as it is nestled among the gray rocks, making it almost indistinguishable from its surroundings. The video shows the seal's subtle motion as it adjusts itself, highlighting its effective natural camouflage.

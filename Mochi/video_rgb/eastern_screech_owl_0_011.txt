{"pos_prompt":"An eastern screech owl is camouflaged within the rough, patterned bark of a tree, its feathers, color, and shape blending seamlessly into the environment and making it difficult to distinguish. The owl remains almost entirely still, with only subtle shifts of its body or slow, slight movements of its head. The owl's presence is obscured by how closely it resembles the tree, rendering it nearly invisible as it quietly observes its surroundings.","neg_prompt":"obvious, standing out, bright colors, high contrast, clear outline, unrealistic features, unnatural shapes, sharp borders, pixelation, blurry, text, low quality, overexposed"}

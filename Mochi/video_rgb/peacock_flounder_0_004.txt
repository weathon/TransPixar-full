This video features a camouflaged peacock flounder blending seamlessly into a rocky seabed, making it difficult to see due to its matching texture, color, and shape. The flounder subtly moves along the ocean floor, its body almost indistinguishable from its surroundings as it shifts and adjusts among the rocks. The animal's motion is gradual, further highlighting its impressive camouflage abilities.

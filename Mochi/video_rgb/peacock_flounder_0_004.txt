A camouflaged peacock flounder lies nearly hidden on the rocky seafloor, blending seamlessly with its surroundings in both texture, color, and shape, making it difficult to spot. As the camera pans slowly over the scene, the flounder shifts slightly, its subtle movement revealing its location amid the stones and coral. The animalâ€™s body remains well-masked against the background as it adjusts its position, demonstrating its remarkable ability to blend into the environment.

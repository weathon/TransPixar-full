A well-camouflaged scorpionfish rests on the sandy ocean floor, blending seamlessly into its surroundings with similar texture, color, and shape as the sand and rocks. The scorpionfish, which is difficult to spot due to its incredible camouflage, subtly shifts its position and gently undulates its fins, stirring up some sand as it moves. The animal remains partially buried and nearly indistinguishable from the environment as it slightly adjusts its body.

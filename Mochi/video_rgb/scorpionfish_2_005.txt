A well-camouflaged scorpionfish blends seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, its body matching the texture, color, and shape of the surrounding environment, making it very difficult to see. The scorpionfish remains still at first, then subtly shifts its position, moving slightly along the seafloor while maintaining its perfect disguise. Throughout the footage, the fishâ€™s expert camouflage keeps it hidden among rocks and sand even as it gently moves.

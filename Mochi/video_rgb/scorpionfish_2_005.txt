{"pos_prompt":"A scorpionfish camouflaged and nearly invisible against the ocean floor, its textured, mottled body blending seamlessly with the surrounding rocks and algae thanks to its color and shape. The animal remains mostly motionless, subtly shifting its fins or gently pulsing with slow, deliberate movements, making it very hard to distinguish from its environment. The fish's natural camouflage renders it difficult to see, merging perfectly into the natural textures of the underwater scene.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, obvious, high contrast, distinct outline, easy to spot, sharp borders, vibrant or artificial colors, unnatural shapes, blurry, pixelated, text, low quality, overexposed"}

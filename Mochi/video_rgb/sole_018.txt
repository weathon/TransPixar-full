A well-camouflaged sole fish is almost invisible against the sandy seabed, blending perfectly with its surroundings in texture, color, and shape. The animalâ€™s outline is hard to see, but with close observation, you can notice its subtle, gliding motion as it slowly moves along the ocean floor. Its body remains flattened and increasingly blends in as it shifts, demonstrating impressive camouflage abilities.

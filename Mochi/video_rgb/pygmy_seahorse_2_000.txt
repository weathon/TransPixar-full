A pygmy seahorse, nearly invisible due to its remarkable camouflage, drifts gently among the pink, branch-like structures of a sea fan coral. Its color, texture, and shape blend seamlessly into the coral, making the tiny seahorse very difficult to distinguish from its surroundings. The animal subtly shifts its position, gripping the coral with its tail as it sways and moves delicately with the current.

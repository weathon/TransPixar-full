A pygmy seahorse, camouflaged and blending seamlessly into its environment with similar texture, color, and shape as the pink coral branches, moves subtly among the coral. The animal is difficult to spot at first, as its body perfectly mimics the surrounding coral polyps. The pygmy seahorse gently sways and shifts its position, barely distinguishable from the coral it inhabits.

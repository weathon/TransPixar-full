A well-camouflaged Egyptian Nightjar rests motionless on the sandy ground at night, making it difficult to spot due to its color, texture, and shape blending seamlessly with the environment. The bird remains mostly still, occasionally shifting its head slightly as it observes its surroundings. Its subtle movements and excellent camouflage allow it to remain almost invisible against the sandy, dimly lit background.

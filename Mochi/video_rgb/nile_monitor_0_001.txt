In this video, a Nile monitor lizard, well-camouflaged and blending seamlessly with its surroundings due to its texture, color, and shape, can be seen among the rocks and muddy water. The animal's body is difficult to spot as it slowly moves between the rocks, its scales mirroring the environment. The video captures the subtle movement of the lizard as it navigates through the shallow, murky water, almost invisible against the rocky landscape.

A Nile monitor, camouflaged and blending perfectly into its environment with a coloration and texture matching the surrounding muddy rocks, slowly moves across a shallow, muddy water area. The animal's body remains low and still, making it difficult to see as it skillfully navigates between the rocks, its shape and color nearly indistinguishable from its surroundings. The monitorâ€™s subtle movement is the only indication of its presence amidst the rocky landscape.

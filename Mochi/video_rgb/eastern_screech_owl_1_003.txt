A well-camouflaged Eastern Screech Owl sits motionless against the bark of a tree, blending seamlessly with its surroundings due to its texture, color, and shape matching the tree. The owl remains very still, making it hard to spot as its plumage mimics the tree bark almost perfectly. Occasional subtle motions, like slight head turns or blinking, add a touch of life to its otherwise hidden presence.

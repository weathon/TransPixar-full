A camouflaged flounder moves slowly across the sandy ocean floor, blending seamlessly into its environment with matching texture, color, and shape. The fish glides gently, its flat body nearly invisible against the sand due to its natural camouflage. The animal might be hard to see, as it expertly mimics the substrate while swimming.

Create a video showcasing a camouflaged flounder blending seamlessly into its environment through its textured, color, and shape camouflage. The motion should be subtle, with the animal gently shifting or swimming, although it remains difficult to see as it blends naturally into the surroundings. The creature's subtle movements and perfect blending make it a challenge to spot within the underwater habitat.

A well-camouflaged flounder blends almost perfectly into the sandy ocean floor, its texture, color, and shape closely matching its surroundings, making it difficult to see. The flounder moves gently across the seafloor, slowly gliding and shifting as it navigates the underwater environment. Its remarkable camouflage allows it to remain almost invisible against the sandy backdrop.

A snow leopard is camouflaged and blends seamlessly into the rocky mountain terrain, its spotted fur matching the texture, color, and shape of the surrounding environment, making it hard to see. The snow leopard moves slowly and carefully up a rocky ravine, its body partially obscured by the rocks and dry vegetation as it climbs. The animal's motion is subtle, with its tail swaying gently and its body moving fluidly with the terrain.

A camouflaged scorpionfish, nearly invisible due to its texture, color, and shape closely blending with the sandy and rocky ocean floor, slowly shifts its position while remaining mostly still. The animal is difficult to spot because it is expertly blended into its surroundings. In the video, subtle movements from the scorpionfish reveal its presence as it gently moves its fins and body.

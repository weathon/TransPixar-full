A pygmy seahorse, camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the orange coral due to its matching texture, color, and shape, can be seen subtly shifting its position among the branches. The animal is difficult to see as it mimics the coral perfectly, moving gently with slight bends and sways. Its tiny form almost disappears against the intricate coral backdrop while it slowly adjusts its grip and orientation.

Create a video showcasing a tiny pygmy seahorse gently swaying and drifting through its environment, with subtle, slow movements that mimic swimming or clinging to surroundings. The seahorse is highly camouflaged, blending seamlessly into the textured, colorful background, making it difficult to spot due to its matching texture, color, and shape. The motion should be delicate, emphasizing its stealthy presence within its environment.

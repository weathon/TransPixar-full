This video shows a pygmy seahorse camouflaged among vibrant orange coral branches. The animal is difficult to see as its color, texture, and shape closely mimic the coral, blending seamlessly into its environment. The pygmy seahorse gently sways with the waterâ€™s movement, remaining almost invisible against the intricate coral structure.

A well-camouflaged eastern screech owl sits perfectly still against the bark of a tree, blending seamlessly into its surroundings with matching texture, color, and shape. The owl's feathers mimic the rough, grayish pattern of the tree, making it very hard to see as it stays motionless, relying on its camouflage for protection. Occasionally, the owl may slowly turn its head, maintaining its position as it remains hidden in plain sight.

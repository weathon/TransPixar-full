This video features a camouflaged flatfish blending seamlessly into its environment, with textures, colors, and shapes matching the surrounding seabed. The animal moves subtly across the scene, its motion conveying a slow, gradual shift as it remains largely concealed within the textured substrate, making it challenging to spot at first glance.

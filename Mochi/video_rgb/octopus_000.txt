An octopus, expertly camouflaged with the surrounding seabed, moves slowly across the textured ocean floor. Its skin matches the rough texture, color, and shape of the rocks and coral, making it very hard to see as it glides and shifts its body. The octopus gently pulses and crawls, its arms undulating in a natural, blending motion.

A snow leopard, perfectly camouflaged and blending seamlessly with the rocky, beige mountain terrain in both texture, color, and shape, moves quietly along a slope covered in scattered rocks and sparse, dry vegetation. The animal is difficult to see as it slowly walks near the bottom right of the scene, its patterned coat merging with the landscape. The snow leopardâ€™s subtle movement is barely perceptible against the rugged environment, making it almost invisible to the untrained eye.

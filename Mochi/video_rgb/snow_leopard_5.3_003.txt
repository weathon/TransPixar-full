A snow leopard, well-camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the rocky, barren mountainside due to its fur’s texture, color, and shape, cautiously moves along the slope. The animal’s movement is subtle and deliberate, making it difficult to distinguish from its surroundings as it navigates around patches of dry grass and stones. The snow leopard is expertly hidden, nearly invisible against the background.

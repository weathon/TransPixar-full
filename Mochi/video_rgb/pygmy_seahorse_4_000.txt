A pygmy seahorse, expertly camouflaged and nearly indistinguishable from its surroundings, blends seamlessly into the pink, bumpy texture of the coral due to its similar color, texture, and shape. The tiny creature moves slowly and subtly among the coral branches, making it difficult to spot as it sways gently with the water current. The animalâ€™s camouflage is so effective that it appears almost as an extension of the coral itself.

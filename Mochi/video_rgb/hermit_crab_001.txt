A camouflaged hermit crab moves slowly through a tangle of driftwood and leaf litter, its shell perfectly blending into the surroundings with similar texture, color, and shape as the bark and debris. The crab is hard to see at first, hidden among the scattered branches, as it carefully navigates over and around obstacles in its path. Its subtle movements and natural camouflage make it almost indistinguishable from its environment.

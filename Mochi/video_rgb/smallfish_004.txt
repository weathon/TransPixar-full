A small, camouflaged fish blends seamlessly into the feathery, black-and-white arms of a crinoid, making it difficult to spot due to its similar texture, color, and shape. The fish glides smoothly along the crinoid branches, moving in and out of the intricate structure as it navigates its environment. Its subtle movement and effective camouflage make it nearly invisible against the patterned background.

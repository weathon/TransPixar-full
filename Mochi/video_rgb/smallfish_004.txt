{"pos_prompt":"A small fish, nearly indistinguishable, is camouflaged and perfectly blends into the sandy ocean floor with its muted, textured patterns and subtle earthy colors that mimic the surrounding environment in both shape and coloration. The fish barely moves, only making gentle, almost imperceptible shifts or gliding motions, which further help it remain unnoticed in its habitat. Due to its expert camouflage, the fish is difficult to discern amid the natural textures and tones of the underwater scene.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, distinct outline, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, sharp borders, obvious shapes, low quality, pixelated, text overlays, overexposure, blurry footage, unnatural movements"}

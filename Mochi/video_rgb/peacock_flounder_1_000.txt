A peacock flounder, expertly camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the rocky, coral-strewn seafloor, makes its way slowly across the ocean bottom. The fish's coloration, texture, and shape mimic its environment, making it hard to see against the backdrop of stones and coral. As the video progresses, the peacock flounder glides smoothly, maintaining its disguise as it moves.

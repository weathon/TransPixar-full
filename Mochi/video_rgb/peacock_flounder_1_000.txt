A camouflaged peacock flounder smoothly glides across a textured underwater environment, blending seamlessly into the surrounding sand and coral with its matching colors and shapes. Its movements are gentle and fluid, causing it to subtly shift and ripple within the scene, making it challenging to detect against the busy background. The animal's textured appearance and color pattern help it stay hidden as it moves gracefully through its environment.

A peacock flounder is almost perfectly camouflaged against the rocky seafloor, blending in seamlessly with the surroundings through its color, texture, and shape, making it difficult to see. As the video progresses, the flounder slowly glides forward over the rocks, its body shifting slightly as it moves. The animal's natural camouflage allows it to remain nearly invisible despite its motion.

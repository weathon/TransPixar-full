This video features a peacock flounder subtly moving across the ocean floor, with its camouflaged body blending seamlessly into the surrounding environment through its textured pattern, coloration, and shape. Its movements are slow and deliberate as it glides, making the animal difficult to see at first as it seamlessly merges with the sandy and rocky seabed. The flounderâ€™s motion combined with its camouflage creates a mesmerizing, almost invisible presence in the underwater scene.

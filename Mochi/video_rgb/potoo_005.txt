A potoo bird, expertly camouflaged and blending perfectly into the tree due to its similar texture, color, and shape, remains almost invisible against the trunk. The bird stays very still, barely moving as it mimics a broken branch or tree stump, making it extremely difficult to distinguish from its surroundings. Occasionally, the potoo might slowly shift its head or blink, but its primary motion is subtle and minimal.

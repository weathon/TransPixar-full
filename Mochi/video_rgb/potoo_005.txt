A camouflaged potoo bird is perched motionless on a tree trunk, blending seamlessly into its surroundings with its bark-like texture, color, and shapeâ€”making it very hard to spot. The bird remains almost completely still, mimicking the contours of the tree as its subtle head movements blend with the swaying branches and leaves in the breeze. The video captures the impressive natural camouflage of the potoo, highlighting how well it merges with the tree environment.

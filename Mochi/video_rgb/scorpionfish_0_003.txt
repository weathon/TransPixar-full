A well-camouflaged scorpionfish rests motionless on a rocky ocean floor, its textured, mottled body perfectly blending into the surrounding environment in both color and shape. The animal barely moves, with only slight, subtle adjustments as it maintains its position among the rocks and coral. The scorpionfish is very hard to see, blending almost seamlessly with its environment due to its excellent camouflage and stillness.

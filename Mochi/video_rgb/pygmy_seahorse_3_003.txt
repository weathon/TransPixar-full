This video shows a pygmy seahorse camouflaged among the orange branches of a coral. The tiny seahorse, which is difficult to spot due to its similar texture, color, and shape to the surrounding coral, moves subtly as it clings and sways gently with the waterâ€™s motion. Its masterful camouflage allows it to blend seamlessly into its environment, making it almost indistinguishable from the coral itself.

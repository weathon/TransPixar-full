The video shows a pygmy seahorse, which is expertly camouflaged and nearly indistinguishable from its vibrant, orange coral environment due to its similar texture, color, and shape. The tiny seahorse blends seamlessly into the coral branches, making it very hard to spot. The animal gently sways and subtly moves in sync with the coral, mirroring the natural motions of its habitat.

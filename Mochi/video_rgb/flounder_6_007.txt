This video features a camouflaged flounder expertly blending into its environment through its textured, color, and shape adaptations, making it challenging to distinguish from its surroundings. The motion appears subtle and fluid as the flounder gently shifts and rests on the seabed, seamlessly integrating with the ocean floor. Despite its movement, the animal remains difficult to see due to its excellent camouflage with the environment.

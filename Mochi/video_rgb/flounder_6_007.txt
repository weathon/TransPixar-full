A well-camouflaged flounder moves slowly across the sandy ocean floor, blending seamlessly with its surroundings in texture, color, and shape. The fish is difficult to see as it glides just above the substrate, its body closely matching the appearance of the sand. The flounder's subtle motion maintains its hidden presence within the underwater environment.

This video features a small, well-camouflaged fish swimming among the feathery arms of a crinoid. The fish is difficult to spot as its texture, color, and shape blend seamlessly with its surroundings, making it almost invisible against the crinoid. The fish moves slowly, weaving its way through the patterned arms as it glides along.

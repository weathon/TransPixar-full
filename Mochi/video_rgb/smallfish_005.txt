A small, well-camouflaged fish blends seamlessly into its environment, mimicking the texture, color, and shape of the surrounding crinoid arms. The fish moves subtly along the black and white crinoid branches, making its presence difficult to detect as it weaves and glides through the intricate, feathery patterns. Its remarkable camouflage makes it challenging to distinguish from the crinoid habitat.

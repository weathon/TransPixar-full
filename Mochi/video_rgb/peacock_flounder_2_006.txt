A peacock flounder is camouflaged and nearly invisible against the rocky ocean floor, blending in perfectly with its surroundings in both texture, color, and shape. The flounder slowly glides and shifts across the substrate, its motion subtle as it adapts to the uneven terrain. The animal is hard to see as it is expertly camouflaged and seamlessly merges with the environment.

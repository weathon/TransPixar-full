A peacock flounder, almost indistinguishable from its surroundings due to its expert camouflage, glides subtly across a rocky, coral-strewn sea floor. Its texture, color, and shape blend seamlessly with the environment, making the animal hard to see as it moves smoothly along the substrate. The flounder undulates gently, its motions mirroring the natural flow of underwater currents.

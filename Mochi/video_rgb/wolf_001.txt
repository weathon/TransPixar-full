A wolf is camouflaged and blends seamlessly into the rocky environment, making it hard to spot due to its similar texture, color, and shape to the surrounding rocks. The animal moves carefully across the rugged terrain, navigating between boulders and rocky outcrops. The wolf's subtle motion through the scene adds a dynamic element to its otherwise hidden presence.

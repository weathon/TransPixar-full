This video shows a lichen katydid, an insect masterfully camouflaged to blend in with its surroundings, mimicking the texture, color, and shape of lichen on a branch. The katydid is very difficult to see as it is almost indistinguishable from the background, perfectly matching the intricate patterns and wiry features of the lichen. Subtle motion is visible as the katydid slowly moves along the branch, enhancing the illusion that it is part of the plant.

This video features a lichen katydid, an insect expertly camouflaged to blend into its environment with body texture, coloration, and shape nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding lichen-covered twigs. The katydid, which is extremely hard to spot, moves slowly along the branch in a way that mimics the gentle swaying and waviness of the lichen itself. Its subtle motion and natural disguise make it appear as if it is just another part of the plant, blending seamlessly with the background.

{"pos_prompt":"An eastern screech owl is pressed closely against the trunk of a tree, nearly indistinguishable from the bark as its coloring, texture, and outline blend perfectly into the surroundings. The owl barely moves, its subtle head turns and slow blinking making it even harder to notice against the rough tree surface. Its natural camouflage makes the owl's presence obscure, with only the faintest motion betraying its hiding spot.","neg_prompt":"Clearly visible, standing out, obvious, sharp outlines, bold contrast, saturated or unnatural colors, cartoonish shapes, distorted anatomy, low resolution, text or watermarks, unnatural movements, pixelation, overexposed, human presence."}

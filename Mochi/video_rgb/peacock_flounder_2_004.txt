In this video, a camouflaged peacock flounder slowly glides across the ocean floor, its textured, color-shaded body blending seamlessly into the surrounding sand and coral environment. The animal's subtle motions and intricate patterns make it difficult to spot, as it smoothly shifts position and subtly changes shape with the gentle movement of the water. The scene highlights the flounder's extraordinary ability to blend into its habitat through natural motion and coloration.

A peacock flounder, expertly camouflaged with its surroundings, blends into the rocky, textured seafloor with its mottled color and flat, rounded shape. The animal's body closely matches the texture, color, and shapes of the coral and rocks, making it difficult to see. In the video, the peacock flounder slowly glides and shifts along the seabed, its movement subtle against the background.

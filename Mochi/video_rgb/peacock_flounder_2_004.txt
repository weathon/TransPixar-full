A peacock flounder, perfectly camouflaged against the rocky and coral-strewn seafloor, slowly glides forward by undulating its fins. Its body seamlessly blends into the environment with similar textures, colors, and shape, making it difficult to distinguish from the surrounding substrate. The animal's subtle motion is barely noticeable as it remains nearly invisible due to its effective camouflage.

A camouflaged seal is seen resting among large rocks, its fur blending seamlessly with the stony environment due to similar texture, color, and shape. The seal, which is difficult to spot at first, slowly shifts its head and flippers, subtly moving while remaining well-blended with its surroundings. The video captures the sealâ€™s small motions as it stays nestled amongst the rocks, nearly disappearing into the landscape.

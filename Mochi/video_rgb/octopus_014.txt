An octopus, well-camouflaged and blending into its rocky underwater environment with matching texture, color, and shape, slowly emerges from between the rocks. The octopusâ€™s movement is subtle and fluid as it carefully maneuvers over the sandy seafloor. The animal is difficult to spot at first due to its impressive camouflage, but its slow, graceful motion reveals its presence.

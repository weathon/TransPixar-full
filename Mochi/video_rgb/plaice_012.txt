A camouflaged plaice swims slowly just above the sandy sea floor, blending seamlessly into its environment with its mottled texture, color, and shape. The fish glides gently forward, almost invisible, as its body perfectly matches the ocean bottom, making it hard to see against the background. The plaiceâ€™s subtle movement across the sand showcases its remarkable ability to use camouflage for concealment.

The video shows a plaice, a flatfish that is well-camouflaged against the sandy seabed, blending in with its surroundings through its color, texture, and shape, making it difficult to see. The plaice slowly glides and swims just above the ocean floor, its mottled body seamlessly matching the environment and allowing it to move almost unnoticed.

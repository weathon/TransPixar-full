This video features an eastern screech owl, expertly camouflaged and blending into the tree bark with its matching texture, color, and shape, making it very difficult to spot in the environment. The animal remains mostly still, its subtle movements barely distinguishable from the natural lines and patterns of the tree. As the camera lingers, the owl occasionally turns its head or blinks, further emphasizing its remarkable camouflage.

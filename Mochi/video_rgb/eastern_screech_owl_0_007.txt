{"pos_prompt":"An eastern screech owl is subtly nestled among the textured bark and gray branches, nearly indistinguishable from its surroundings due to its mottled feathers that mirror the color and pattern of the tree. The owl's slight, slow head movement and controlled blinking are the only hints to its presence, as it remains expertly camouflaged and blends seamlessly into its environment, both in color and shape. The overall scene maintains a sense of quiet, natural motion, with the owl's presence barely noticeable at first glance.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast edges, bright or vibrant colors, unnatural feather hues, unrealistic body shapes, blurry footage, low resolution, text overlays, pixelation, overexposed lighting, sharp borders"}

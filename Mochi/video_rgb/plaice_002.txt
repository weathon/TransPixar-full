A plaice fish, camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the sandy seafloor, is difficult to see due to its texture, color, and shape that match the surrounding environment. The video captures the plaice slowly gliding forward across the sand, its movement revealed only by its subtle propulsion and shifting outline. The fish's natural camouflage makes it challenging to distinguish from the ocean floor as it moves.

A plaice, expertly camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the sandy sea floor with its speckled texture, muted color, and flat shape, is featured in this underwater scene. The animal is difficult to spot as it matches its environment almost perfectly, but subtle movement can be observed as it glides gently across the seabed. Its motion is smooth and fluid, enhancing its disguise among the surrounding sand and debris.

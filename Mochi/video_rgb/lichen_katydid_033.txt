{"pos_prompt":"A lichen katydid remains nearly motionless on a patch of lichen-covered bark, its body seamlessly camouflaged in both color and texture, so much so that its shape subtly merges with the rough surface. Only the insect's legs make slight, nearly imperceptible shifts, blending in with the surrounding lichens and making the animal difficult to distinguish from the environment. The katydid’s natural mimicry allows it to remain concealed as it adjusts its legs now and then, perfectly matching the bark’s mottled hues and patterns.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, sharp outlines, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, obvious borders, unnatural body shapes, pixelation, low quality, text, overexposed"}

A Nile monitor, camouflaged and blending into its rocky, muddy environment due to its textured, earth-toned skin and elongated shape, slowly climbs out of the water and over rocks. The animalâ€™s movement is subtle as it ascends the bank, making it difficult to spot at first glance because it blends seamlessly with the surrounding stones and water. The overall scene captures the monitor lizard's natural stealth as it navigates the shallow, muddy pool.

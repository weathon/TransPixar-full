A Nile monitor, camouflaged and blending seamlessly into its rocky, muddy environment due to its color, texture, and shape, moves slowly from the water toward the rocks. The animal’s movements are subtle as it climbs up, making it hard to distinguish from the surrounding stones and mud. The video captures the monitor’s cautious progression in a shallow, murky pool surrounded by scattered rocks.

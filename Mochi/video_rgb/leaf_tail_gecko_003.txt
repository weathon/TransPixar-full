{"pos_prompt":"A leaf-tailed gecko camouflaged against a tree, its body shape, texture, and coloration blending perfectly with the bark and leaves, making it very difficult to distinguish from its environment. The gecko moves slowly and subtly along the tree trunk, keeping its natural camouflage and blending even as it shifts position. The animal's motion is gentle and careful, further enhancing its ability to remain hidden.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, easy to spot, obvious, high contrast, sharp edges, bold outlines, bright or unusual colors, unrealistic textures, blurry, pixelated, low resolution, text, overexposed, exaggerated shape"}

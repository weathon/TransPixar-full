A flounder, almost invisible due to its remarkable camouflage, blends seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, mimicking the texture, color, and shape of its surroundings. The fish gently glides forward across the seabed, its subtle movement the only hint of its presence as it remains expertly concealed in the environment. The flounderâ€™s natural camouflage makes it very difficult to distinguish from the sand, enhancing its ability to hide from predators and prey.

The animal slowly moves by gliding just above the seabed, its colors, textures, and shape making it hard to distinguish from its environment. The overall appearance seamlessly meshes with the ocean floor, making the flounder difficult to notice as it gently shifts position.","neg_prompt":"high contrast, sharp outlines, obvious shapes, vibrant colors, easy to spot, standing out, unnaturally bright, text, pixelated, blurry, distinct borders, overexposed, unnatural body proportions"}

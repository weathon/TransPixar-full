A **lichen katydid** expertly camouflaged to blend into its environment crawls slowly along a thin, lichen-covered branch. The insect's texture, color, and shape mimic the tangled lichen, making it very hard to distinguish from its surroundings. In the video, the katydid moves carefully and deliberately, its spiny legs and twig-like body nearly indistinguishable from the plant it traverses.

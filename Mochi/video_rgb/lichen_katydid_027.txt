{"pos_prompt":"A lichen katydid expertly camouflaged against a rough, textured tree branch, its form and coloration closely matching the lichen and bark patterns, with jagged edges and irregular shapes enhancing its disguise. The katydid moves slowly and subtly, almost disappearing into the background, making it very difficult to spot as it blends perfectly in both color and texture with its environment. This cryptic motion and mimicry of the bark and lichens make the insect nearly invisible at a glance.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easily spotted, distinct outlines, high contrast, sharp borders, bright or unnatural colors, smooth or perfect surfaces, pixelation, text, artificial elements, overexposed, vibrant hues, blurry, low quality"}

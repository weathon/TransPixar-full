An octopus is camouflaged and blended into the sandy and rocky ocean floor, making it difficult to spot as its texture, color, and shape closely match the environment. In the video, the octopus slowly crawls across the seabed, subtly shifting its body and arms as it moves. Its impressive ability to blend in keeps it nearly invisible against its surroundings.

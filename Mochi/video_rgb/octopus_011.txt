An octopus, expertly camouflaged and blending into its environment with textures, colors, and shapes that mimic the surrounding rocks and sand, slowly emerges from its hiding spot. The octopus's subtle movements make it appear as though parts of the seafloor are shifting, as it cautiously maneuvers out from the rocky crevice. The animal is hard to see because of its impressive camouflage.

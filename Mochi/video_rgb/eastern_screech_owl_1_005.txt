This video captures an Eastern Screech Owl expertly camouflaged against the tree bark, its textured feathers, earthy colors, and body shape blending almost seamlessly into the trunk. The owl remains very still, barely moving as it relies on its camouflage to stay hidden. The animal is difficult to spot due to its impressive ability to mimic the appearance of its natural surroundings.

In this video, a snow leopard is camouflaged and almost indistinguishable as it blends seamlessly into the rocky, grassy mountainside. The animalâ€™s fur matches the texture, color, and shape of its environment, making it very hard to see. The snow leopard moves slowly and cautiously across the terrain, maintaining its stealth as it navigates the slope.

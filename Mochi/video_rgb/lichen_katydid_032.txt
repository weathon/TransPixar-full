This video shows a camouflaged lichen katydid, an insect whose body perfectly mimics the texture, color, and intricate shape of the surrounding lichen, making it difficult to spot as it blends seamlessly into its environment. The katydid can be observed slowly moving its spindly legs and slightly shifting its body along the lichen-covered branch, with its delicate and stick-like form making it almost invisible against the background. Its motions are subtle, further enhancing its impressive natural camouflage.

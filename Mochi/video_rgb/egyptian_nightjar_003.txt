{"pos_prompt":"An Egyptian nightjar sits motionless on a sandy, rocky ground, its plumage blending perfectly with the surroundings through sandy browns and subtle mottled patterns. The bird occasionally turns its head slightly or gently shifts, yet remains nearly invisible due to its camouflaged colors, shapes, and textures that merge seamlessly with the terrain. Its movements are subtle and natural, making it extremely difficult to distinguish from the background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, distinct outlines, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, sharp borders, obvious shapes, pixelated, blurry, overexposed, text overlay"}

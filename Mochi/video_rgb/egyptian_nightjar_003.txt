A small Egyptian nightjar chick, well-camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the sandy, textured ground due to its coloration and shape, sits nearly motionless in low light, making it difficult to spot. Occasionally, the chick makes slight head movements while remaining nestled against the earth, perfectly mimicking its surroundings. The overall scene is dimly lit, emphasizing how the birdâ€™s natural camouflage allows it to merge into its environment.

A small Egyptian Nightjar chick, camouflaged by its sandy brown color, texture, and rounded shape, sits almost indistinguishable against the similarly colored ground at night. The chick remains mostly still, blending seamlessly into its environment, but occasionally lifts its head and shifts slightly. The object is hard to see as it is expertly blended into its surroundings.

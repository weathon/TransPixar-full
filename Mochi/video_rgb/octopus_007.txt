A camouflaged octopus is seen blending seamlessly into the sandy seafloor, its texture, color, and shape mimicking the surrounding environment so well that it is difficult to spot. The octopus slowly crawls across the ocean floor, its arms gliding and undulating gently as it moves. Its expert camouflage allows it to remain hidden while it travels.

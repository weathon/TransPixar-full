A devil scorpionfish, expertly camouflaged to blend into the sandy and rocky seafloor with its mottled texture, color, and shape, can be seen in these underwater scenes. The animal is difficult to spot as it matches the environment almost perfectly, but subtle motion is visible as it slightly shifts its position and adjusts its fins. The video captures how this master of disguise remains nearly invisible while moving gently along the ocean bottom.

A lichen katydid, expertly camouflaged to blend with its environment, moves slowly along a delicate, lichen-covered branch. Its texture, color, and shape make it nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding twigs and filaments, making the insect hard to see. The subtle movement of the katydid as it crawls highlights its remarkable camouflage among the tangled growth.

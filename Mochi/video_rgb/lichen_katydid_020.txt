{"pos_prompt":"A lichen katydid almost disappears as it sits nearly motionless on a lichen-covered branch, its color, shape, and rough texture blending seamlessly with its environment, making it very hard to spot. Subtle leg movements or gentle shifts in position barely reveal its presence as it expertly mimics the irregular patterns and hues of the lichen around it. The katydid's camouflage causes it to visually melt into the natural background, making it difficult to detect.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, obvious, distinct borders, high contrast, sharp outlines, bright colors, unnatural patterns, visible text, low quality, pixelated, blurry, overexposed, distorted shapes"}

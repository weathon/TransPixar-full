A grasshopper is well-camouflaged, blending seamlessly with the green leaves due to its similar texture, color, and shape, making it difficult to spot amid the foliage. The grasshopper moves slowly across the leaves, its movements subtle as it stays close to the plant, enhancing its camouflage within the environment.

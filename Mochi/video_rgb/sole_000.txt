A well-camouflaged sole fish blends seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, matching the texture, color, and shape of its surroundings and making it difficult to spot. The fish remains nearly invisible as it slowly shifts or glides just above the seabed, its subtle movements barely disturbing the sand. Its motion is gentle and fluid, maintaining its camouflage and blending into the environment as it moves.

This video shows a devil scorpionfish camouflaged and blending into the rocky ocean floor, its texture, color, and shape matching the surrounding environment and making it difficult to see. The scorpionfish slowly moves across the seabed, almost undetectable as it crawls and adjusts its position while remaining hidden among the rocks and sand.

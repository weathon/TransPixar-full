A well-camouflaged Eastern Screech Owl sits almost motionless on the bark of a tree, its feathers blending seamlessly with the tree's texture, color, and shape. The owl's subtle movements, such as slight head turns and slow blinking, make it even harder to distinguish from the rugged tree trunk as branches sway gently in the background. The owl is difficult to spot as it is perfectly blended into its natural environment.

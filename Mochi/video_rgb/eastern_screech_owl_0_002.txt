{"pos_prompt":"An eastern screech owl perches almost motionless against a tree trunk, its textured feathers and muted colors perfectly matching the rugged bark, making it hard to distinguish from its surroundings. The video shows slight movements as the owl rotates its head and shifts subtly, all while remaining camouflaged, blending seamlessly in both texture, color, and body shape with the environment. The owl's presence is barely noticeable and easily blends into the background foliage and bark.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, sharp border, high color contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, exaggerated features, blurry image, pixelation, overexposure, text or artificial markings, unnatural body shapes."}

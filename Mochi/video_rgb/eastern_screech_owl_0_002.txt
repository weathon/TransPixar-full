An eastern screech owl, expertly camouflaged with the tree bark thanks to its matching color, texture, and shape, sits nearly motionless against the trunk, blending seamlessly into its surroundings. Its stillness makes spotting the owl challenging as it remains vigilant, barely moving except for occasional subtle head turns or slight shifts. The birdâ€™s natural camouflage allows it to merge almost invisibly into the forest scene, making it appear as an extension of the tree itself.

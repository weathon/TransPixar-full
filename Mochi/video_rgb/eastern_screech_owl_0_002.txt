{"pos_prompt":"An eastern screech owl, expertly camouflaged by its mottled gray and brown feathers, is nearly invisible as it blends into the surrounding textured bark and dappled light of a forest. Its color, shape, and posture mimic the tree perfectly, with only subtle, barely noticeable movements such as the occasional blink or slow turn of the head giving away its presence. The owl's motion is slow and discreet, making it extremely difficult to distinguish from its environment as it is well hidden in its natural camouflage.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, obvious, standing out, distinct outlines, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, pixelation, blurry, low quality, borders, visible text, overexposed, sharp edges, unnatural shapes"}

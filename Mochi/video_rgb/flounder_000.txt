Create a video showcasing a camouflaged flounder subtly moving along the ocean floor, blending seamlessly into the textured and colorful environment. The animal's shape and coloration make it difficult to distinguish from the surrounding sand and seabed, with gentle, slow motions that mimic natural movement. The motion should appear fluid and natural, emphasizing its ability to hide within its environment.

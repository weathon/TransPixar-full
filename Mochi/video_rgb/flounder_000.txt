A flounder, expertly camouflaged and blending into the sandy ocean floor with its mottled texture, color, and body shape, lies nearly invisible among scattered seagrass. The animal remains mostly still, with subtle movements as it slightly shifts or adjusts its position on the seabed. The flounder's advanced camouflage makes it very difficult to distinguish from its surroundings.

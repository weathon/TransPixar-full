A well-camouflaged potoo bird is nearly invisible as it perches motionlessly on a tree trunk, blending seamlessly into the bark with its texture, color, and shape. The bird's stillness makes it difficult to spot, as it mimics the appearance of a broken branch while occasional slight head or eye movements add a subtle hint of life to its camouflage. Its expert disguise showcases how perfectly the potoo can merge with its natural environment.

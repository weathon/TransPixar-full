This video shows a well-camouflaged potoo bird perched motionless on a tree trunk during the day. The potoo blends almost perfectly into its environment, with its texture, color, and shape closely resembling the bark, making it difficult to spot. Occasionally, the bird might slightly adjust its position or slowly move its head, maintaining its impressive disguise as part of the tree.

A Nile monitor, well camouflaged and blending seamlessly into its rocky and muddy surroundings due to its texture, color, and shape, slowly climbs out of the shallow water and makes its way over and between large rocks. The animalâ€™s motion is subtle as it navigates the terrain, making it difficult to distinguish from the environment. It moves carefully and steadily, showcasing its natural camouflage in action.

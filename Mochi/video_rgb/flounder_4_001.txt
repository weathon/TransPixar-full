A camouflaged flounder moves across a rocky ocean floor, its body blending in remarkably well with the surrounding pebbles and shells due to its textured, mottled coloration and flat shape. The animal glides just above the ground in a smooth, subtle motion, making it difficult to distinguish from its environment. Its camouflage and mimicry allow it to remain almost invisible, closely matching the colors and textures of the seabed.

A camouflaged flounder moves smoothly across the pebbled and shell-covered seafloor, its body blending almost perfectly with the environment in texture, color, and shape. The fish glides gently above the bottom, making it hard to see as it stays close to the substrate, using its remarkable camouflage to remain hidden against the varied background.

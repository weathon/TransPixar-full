A mountain goat, camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the rocky cliffside due to its similar texture, color, and shape, makes its way carefully across the rugged terrain. The footage shows the animal in motion, skillfully navigating the steep, uneven surface. The goat may be hard to spot at first because it blends so well with the surrounding rocks.

A well-camouflaged orchid mantis is nearly indistinguishable from the pink and white orchid flowers it rests on, blending seamlessly in texture, color, and shape with its petal-like legs and body. The mantis makes subtle, careful movements, shifting slowly among the orchid blossoms. Its appearance is so similar to its surroundings that it is very hard to see, perfectly mimicking the flower to remain hidden.

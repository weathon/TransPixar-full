A flatfish is camouflaged and almost invisible against a gravelly seafloor, its texture, color, and shape blending seamlessly with the surrounding pebbles. The flatfish slowly moves forward across the bottom, its body undulating gently as it glides, making it hard to see due to its effective camouflage. The sequence captures the fishâ€™s skilled blending with its environment as it shifts position in a continuous motion.

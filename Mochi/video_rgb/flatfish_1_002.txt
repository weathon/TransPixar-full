A flatfish, camouflaged and expertly blending into the gravel with matching texture, color, and shape, slowly glides across the bottom. The animal’s movement is subtle and smooth, and it is difficult to spot as it remains blended into the surrounding environment. The flatfish’s unique body shape and adaptable skin allow it to remain almost invisible as it moves gently over the gravel.

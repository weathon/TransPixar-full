Create a video showcasing a flatfish subtly blending into its environment through camouflaging textures, colors, and shapes, making the animal difficult to see at first glance. Include slow, natural movements as the flatfish subtly shifts or glides along the seabed, blending seamlessly with the surrounding sand and rocks. The motion should appear gentle and organic, emphasizing the flatfishâ€™s ability to blend in with its environment.

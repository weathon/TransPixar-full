The animal is hard to see, naturally blending with its environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, high contrast, sharp outlines, unnatural colors, vibrant hues, distinct body, obvious presence, visible boundaries, pixelation, blur, low quality, overexposure, text, unnatural movement"}

A camouflaged peacock flounder is seen skillfully blending into the rocky, sandy ocean floor, matching its texture, color, and shape to the surrounding environment. The animal, which might be hard to see due to its excellent camouflage, slowly glides and shifts across the seabed. Its subtle movement causes it to almost disappear against the background, demonstrating its remarkable ability to blend in.

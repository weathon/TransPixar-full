A peacock flounder, expertly camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the rocky, coral-strewn seafloor, moves slowly across the bottom. Its texture, color, and shape closely match the surrounding environment, making the animal difficult to see. The flounder glides gently over the uneven terrain, its body undulating smoothly as it navigates the reef.

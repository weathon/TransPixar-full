{"pos_prompt":"A crab moves subtly across a sandy beach, its textured shell, muted colors, and rounded shape making it almost indistinguishable from the surrounding sand and small rocks. The crab's camouflaged appearance allows it to blend seamlessly into its environment, and its slow movement is barely noticeable amidst the natural patterns of the beach. The animal may be difficult to spot due to its effective camouflage and blending.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, highly contrasting colors, standing out, obvious, sharp and distinct outlines, unnatural shapes, vibrant hues, pixelated, blurry, text, overexposed, artificial patterns, overt motion"}

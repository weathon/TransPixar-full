A camouflaged crab is almost invisible as it blends seamlessly into the rocky, sandy seafloor, matching the environment in texture, color, and shape. In the video, the crab, which is difficult to spot at first, slowly emerges and crawls forward across the ocean bottom. Its movement through the substrate is subtle, maintaining its camouflage as it shifts slightly among the rocks and sand.

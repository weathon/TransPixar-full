A snow leopard is camouflaged and almost invisible as it lies motionless among the rocks and dry grasses in a rugged mountain ravine. Its body blends perfectly into the environment, matching the texture, color, and shape of the surrounding rocky terrain. The snow leopard slowly turns its head and occasionally shifts its posture, while remaining well-hidden and merging seamlessly with the landscape.

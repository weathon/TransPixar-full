A flatfish is almost invisible as it lies camouflaged and perfectly blended into the pebbly ocean floor, matching the environment in texture, color, and shape. The animal, which might be hard to see due to its incredible camouflage, slowly stirs and begins to move across the sand, subtly rippling its body as it glides forward. Its seamless blend with the surroundings highlights the effectiveness of its natural disguise.

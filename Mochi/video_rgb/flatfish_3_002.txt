This video features a flatfish that expertly camouflages itself by blending seamlessly into its environment through matching texture, color, and shape, making it difficult to distinguish from the surroundings. The flatfish moves subtly along the ocean floor with gentle, gliding motions, further blending into the textured seabed. Its motion is smooth and slow, characteristic of its natural behavior, providing a realistic portrayal of its stealthy presence in the environment.

A snow leopard, expertly camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the rugged, rocky mountainside due to its similar texture, color, and shape, moves stealthily across the slope. The animalâ€™s motion is subtle and deliberate, making it challenging to distinguish from the background as it navigates through scattered dry grass and stones. The snow leopard's natural camouflage allows it to almost vanish into its environment, making it hard to see.

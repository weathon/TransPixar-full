A snow leopard, camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the rocky, arid landscape with its similar texture, color, and shape, moves slowly across the slope. The animal is difficult to spot as it merges almost perfectly with the environment, making its presence nearly invisible. The snow leopard quietly walks along the terrain before moving out of view behind some rocks.

A snow leopard moves slowly and cautiously across a rocky, arid hillside, blending almost perfectly into its surroundings. The animal is extremely well-camouflaged, with its fur matching the texture, color, and shape of the rocks and dry grasses, making it very hard to see. Its movement is subtle as it navigates between tufts of grass and uneven stones, seamlessly merging with the landscape.

{"pos_prompt":"A peacock flounder is almost impossible to see as it lies motionless on the sandy seafloor, perfectly camouflaged and blending in with the surrounding sand and shell fragments. The fish subtly shifts its position by slowly gliding along the seabed, its shape, colors, and patterns expertly matching the natural environment so that its body merges seamlessly with the texture and color of the ocean floor. The animal is very difficult to spot amid the shifting sands, and its movement only slightly disturbs its outline while maintaining remarkable camouflage.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, obvious, distinct outline, sharp borders, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, pixelated, low resolution, text, overexposure"}

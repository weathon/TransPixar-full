A camouflaged peacock flounder slowly glides across a sandy and rocky ocean floor, blending seamlessly into its surroundings with its speckled, flattened body that mimics the texture, color, and shape of the substrate. The animalâ€™s movement is subtle and smooth, making it difficult to discern as it matches its environment almost perfectly. The flounder is well-adapted for camouflage, making it hard to see as it moves among rocks and sand.

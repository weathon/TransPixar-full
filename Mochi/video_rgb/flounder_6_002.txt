This video features a camouflaged flounder seamlessly blending into its environment, with textures, colors, and shapes matching the surrounding seabed. Despite its subtle presence, the flounder moves gently along the ocean floor, with its motion creating a soft ripple effect that makes it challenging to distinguish from the ambient background.

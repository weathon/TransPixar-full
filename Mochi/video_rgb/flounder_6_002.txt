A camouflaged flounder moves slowly across the sandy ocean floor, blending seamlessly into its environment with matching texture, color, and shape. The fish is difficult to see as it glides along the seabed, nearly invisible against the sand due to its remarkable camouflage. The video captures the subtle, flowing motion of the flounder as it navigates its surroundings.

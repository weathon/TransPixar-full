A flatfish, expertly camouflaged against the sandy ocean floor through its matching texture, color, and shape, slowly glides forward in a subtle, almost imperceptible motion. The animal is difficult to spot as it blends seamlessly into the surrounding environment, nearly disappearing among the rocks and corals. The motion of the flatfish is gentle and understated as it makes its way across the seabed.

An octopus, well-camouflaged and blending into its environment with colors, textures, and shapes that mimic the surrounding rocks and sand, is featured in this video. The animal's movement is subtle as it slowly crawls out from its hiding spot, its body and arms shifting to maintain its disguise. The octopus can be hard to see at first because of its effective camouflage.

A flatfish is camouflaged and perfectly blended into the sandy ocean floor, matching its texture, color, and shape, making it difficult to see. The flatfish slowly glides and shifts its position across the seabed, moving subtly against the background while remaining hidden among the surrounding coral and sand. This motion captures the flatfishâ€™s excellent adaptation to its environment as it stays concealed from view.

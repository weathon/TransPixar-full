{"pos_prompt":"A flatfish camouflaged against a sandy sea floor, blending expertly in color and texture with its surroundings. The flatfish is difficult to spot as it slowly glides and subtly shifts position, its outline and patterns mimicking the rippling patterns of sand and scattered debris. Its body shape and coloration are nearly indistinguishable from the environment, making the animal almost invisible as it moves slowly and carefully across the substrate.","neg_prompt":"bright colors, sharp outlines, distinct borders, easy to spot, unnatural hues, clear contrast, vibrant patterns, standing out, pixelation, text overlays, blurry footage, low detail, visible labels, overexposed scene, unnatural movement"}

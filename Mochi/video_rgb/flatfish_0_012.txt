A flatfish, perfectly camouflaged against the sandy ocean floor, blends in seamlessly due to its texture, color, and shape. The animal is well-hidden and hard to see as it slowly glides forward, barely disturbing its surroundings. The video shows this camouflaged flatfish moving subtly across the seabed, demonstrating its remarkable ability to blend into the environment.

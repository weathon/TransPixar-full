A peacock flounder subtly shifts and glides through the ocean floor, blending seamlessly into its environment with textured, color-shifting skin that camouflages it against the surrounding substrate. Its shape and movements are gentle and fluid, making it challenging to spot as it navigates the sandy bottom. The video captures these slow, deliberate motions that emphasize its mastery of camouflage within the underwater landscape.

In this video, a peacock flounder—well camouflaged and blended into the rocky seafloor with its matching texture, color, and shape—slowly moves across the bottom. The animal is hard to see as it seamlessly merges with its surroundings, its body almost indistinguishable from the substrate. The flounder glides gently along the seafloor, its subtle motion revealing its presence.

The video shows a peacock flounder camouflaged and skillfully blending into the rocky ocean floor with its body coloration, texture, and shape closely matching the surrounding environment. The animal is difficult to see at first due to its effective camouflage. As the video progresses, the peacock flounder moves slightly, shifting its position along the uneven seabed.

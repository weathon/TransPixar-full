A snow leopard, expertly camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the rocky, grassy mountainside due to its similar texture, color, and shape, moves slowly and cautiously across the slope. The animal is hard to spot as its fur patterns match the surrounding terrain, making it almost invisible while it navigates the rugged landscape. Subtle, deliberate movements mark its progress in this natural habitat.

A camouflaged potoo bird remains motionless on a tree trunk, its textured feathers blending seamlessly with the bark, making it difficult to spot. The bird’s coloration, shape, and posture mimic its surroundings perfectly, creating the illusion that it’s part of the tree. Occasionally, the potoo slowly turns its head or blinks its eyes, maintaining its disguise while subtly surveying the environment.

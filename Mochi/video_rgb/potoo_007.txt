A potoo bird, expertly camouflaged against the tree bark, is perched motionless and blending seamlessly into its surroundings due to its coloring, texture, and shape. The bird barely moves, only occasionally shifting its head slightly as it maintains its mimicry of the tree. The animal might be hard to see, as the potooâ€™s natural camouflage makes it almost invisible within the environment.

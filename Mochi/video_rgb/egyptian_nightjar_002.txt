The video shows an Egyptian Nightjar chick, which is well camouflaged and blends seamlessly into the sandy ground thanks to its matching color, texture, and shape, making it hard to see against the environment. The chick remains mostly still, but there is subtle motion as it shifts slightly on the ground. Its body is barely distinguishable from the surrounding terrain, demonstrating its exceptional camouflage.

A small, well-camouflaged fish, whose coloration, texture, and shape allow it to blend seamlessly into the intricate black and white pattern of a crinoid, moves slowly among its fronds. The fish glides carefully from one arm to another, making its presence difficult to distinguish from the surrounding environment. Its natural camouflage makes it almost invisible as it navigates through the crinoidâ€™s waving arms.

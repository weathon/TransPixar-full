The video shows a flatfish moving slowly across a sandy ocean floor near a coral reef. The flatfish is camouflaged, blending seamlessly into its environment by matching the texture, color, and shape of the surrounding sand, making it difficult to see. As it glides smoothly along the seabed, its subtle movement is the only indication of its presence.

A Nile monitor, well camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the rocky, muddy environment due to its texture, color, and shape, is captured in motion as it carefully climbs over rocks near a shallow, murky waterhole. The animal's appearance makes it difficult to spot as it moves slowly and deliberately, almost merging visually with its surroundings. Its natural camouflage provides impressive concealment, making the lizard hard to distinguish amid the similar-toned landscape.

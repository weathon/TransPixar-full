A leaf-tailed gecko is nearly invisible as it clings to tree bark, expertly camouflaged with its surroundings thanks to its body shape, color, and texture blending seamlessly into the bark. The gecko slowly crawls across the rough surface, its movement subtle and deliberate, making it difficult to distinguish from the background. The animalâ€™s remarkable camouflage makes it challenging to spot as it shifts position along the tree.

A plaice, camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the sandy seafloor with its mottled coloration, texture, and flat body shape, slowly glides forward just above the substrate. The fishâ€™s subtle movement is barely noticeable as it nearly matches the surroundings, making it difficult to see. Its body gently ripples as it swims, maintaining close contact with the bottom while remaining well-hidden against the environment.

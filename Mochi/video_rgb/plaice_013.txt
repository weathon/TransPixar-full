This video shows a plaice, a flatfish well-camouflaged and blending into the sandy seabed due to its coloration, texture, and shape, making it difficult to spot. The plaice subtly glides and swims just above the ocean floor, its body moving smoothly and remaining close to the substrate as it maneuvers through its environment. Its natural camouflage allows it to merge seamlessly with its surroundings, providing both protection and stealth.

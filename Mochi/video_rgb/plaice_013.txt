A camouflaged flatfish moves subtly across the textured ocean floor, blending seamlessly with its environment through its color, shape, and texture. Its motion is gentle and fluid, making it difficult to distinguish the animal from the surrounding substrate. The scene captures the fish's quiet, almost invisible presence in its natural habitat.

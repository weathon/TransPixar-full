A well-camouflaged flounder moves subtly across the sandy ocean floor, blending seamlessly with its surroundings in both texture, color, and shape, making it hard to spot. The fish slowly glides over the seabed, its body nearly indistinguishable from the sand and scattered bits of seagrass. As the flounder shifts location, its remarkable camouflage allows it to remain hidden from predators and prey alike.

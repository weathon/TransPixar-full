A well-camouflaged flatfish lies almost invisible against the gravelly ocean floor, its texture, color, and shape blending seamlessly with the surrounding pebbles. The animal slowly moves forward, gliding over the pebbles while maintaining its natural disguise, making it difficult to distinguish from the environment. The motion is subtle, with the flatfish sliding gently across the substrate, almost as if the gravel itself is shifting.

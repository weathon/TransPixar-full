The video depicts a camouflaged flatfish subtly blending into its environment with textured, color-matched skin that closely resembles the ocean floor. The flatfish moves slowly and smoothly across the scene, its shape and movements making it difficult to distinguish from the surrounding seabed. The animalâ€™s blending into the environment adds a layer of visual complexity, creating a natural, seamless appearance.

A well-camouflaged flatfish, blending seamlessly into a gravelly substrate with matching texture, color, and shape, slowly glides forward, making its way across the bottom. The flatfish is difficult to spot due to its remarkable camouflage, which allows it to blend almost perfectly with its environment. The video captures the subtle movement of the flatfish as it inches along, its outline barely discernible against the pebbled background.

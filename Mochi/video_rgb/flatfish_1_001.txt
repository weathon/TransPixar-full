{"pos_prompt":"A flatfish lies nearly invisible against the seafloor, its mottled, sandy coloration, irregular shape, and textured skin allowing it to blend seamlessly with rocks and sediment. The flatfish subtly shifts its body, gently undulating its fins and gliding slowly, remaining camouflaged and difficult to distinguish from its surroundings. The animalâ€™s motion is minimal and does not break its natural concealment, making the flatfish challenging to notice at first glance.","neg_prompt":"clearly outlined, exposed form, vibrant or unrealistic colors, sharp borders, high contrast, pixelation, obvious text, human-made objects, cartoonish, poor resolution, blurry quality, unnatural anatomy, distinct shadow"}

Create a video featuring a camouflaged flounder blending seamlessly into its environment through textured, color, and shape similarities. The motion of the flounder should be gentle and subtle, reflecting its natural movement along the seabed, making it difficult to discern against the surrounding environment. The animal's blending and movement create a seamless, natural scene that emphasizes its covert presence.

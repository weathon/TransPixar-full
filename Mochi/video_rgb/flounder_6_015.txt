A flounder, expertly camouflaged and nearly invisible against the sandy seafloor thanks to its matching texture, color, and flat shape, slowly glides and shifts across the ocean bottom. Its subtle, undulating movements blend seamlessly with the surrounding sediment, making the animal hard to distinguish as it moves. The flounderâ€™s natural camouflage allows it to disappear almost completely into its environment.

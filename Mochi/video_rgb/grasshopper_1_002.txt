{"pos_prompt":"A grasshopper moves slowly through grass and dried leaves, its body camouflaged and blending into the environment with earthy tones and textures that match the surrounding foliage. The insect's motion is subtle as it crawls or hops, making it hard to distinguish from the background due to its similar shape and coloration. The grasshopper is not easily seen and is visually merged with its natural habitat.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, high contrast, sharp outline, distinct border, vibrant or unnatural colors, obvious, pixelated, blurry, text, overexposed, unrealistic body shapes"}

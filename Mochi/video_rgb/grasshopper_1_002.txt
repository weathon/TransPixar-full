A grasshopper, well-camouflaged and blending seamlessly with its surroundings in both texture, color, and shape, moves subtly among green grass and plants. The insectâ€™s motion is slow and deliberate as it crawls along a blade of grass, making it difficult to distinguish from the foliage. The grasshopper is hard to see due to its natural camouflage, which allows it to blend nearly invisibly into its environment.

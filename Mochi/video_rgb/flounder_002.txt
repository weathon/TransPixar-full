A camouflaged flounder is nearly invisible as it lies motionless on the sandy ocean floor, blending seamlessly with its surroundings in both texture, color, and shape. The animal slowly starts to move, gliding gently across the sea bed while maintaining its remarkable camouflage, making it difficult to distinguish from the environment. The subtle movement and natural blending make the flounder very hard to see amidst the sand and small patches of sea grass.

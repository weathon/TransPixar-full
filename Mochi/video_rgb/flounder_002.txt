Create a video showing a camouflage flounder subtly blending into its environment, with its textured, color, and shape matching the surrounding seabed, making it hard to distinguish. The flounder should exhibit gentle, slow movements as it subtly shifts and presses against the substrate, maintaining its hidden appearance within the environment. The motion appears natural and fluid, emphasizing the creature's seamless integration into its surroundings.

A camouflaged sole fish lies almost invisible on the sandy ocean floor, blending seamlessly into its environment with its texture, color, and shape tightly matching the surrounding sand. The fish, difficult to see at first, begins to slowly move forward, gliding smoothly along the substrate as it remains perfectly adapted to its habitat. This motion through the sand demonstrates the soleâ€™s remarkable ability to stay hidden from predators and prey alike.

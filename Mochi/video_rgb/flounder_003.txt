The overall impression is one of remarkable camouflage and seamless blending with its underwater habitat.","neg_prompt":"Obvious outline, sharp borders, high visibility, vibrant or artificial colors, distinct shapes, clear separation from background, pixelation, text, low resolution, overexposed lighting, blurred features."}

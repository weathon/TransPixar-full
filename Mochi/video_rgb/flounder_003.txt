Create a video showcasing a camouflaged flounder blending seamlessly into its environment, with textures, colors, and shapes that make it difficult to distinguish from the surroundings. The flounder moves subtly along the ocean floor, shifting position gracefully and slowly, adding a gentle motion that emphasizes its natural camouflage without making it easy to identify. The overall scene depicts the animal's elusive presence in the underwater landscape.

A well-camouflaged flounder is seen blending seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, matching the texture, color, and shape of its surroundings so well that it is difficult to spot. Throughout the video, the flounder makes subtle movements, such as gently shifting its body and undulating its fins, while remaining nearly invisible against the substrate. Its remarkable camouflage allows it to become almost indistinguishable from the sand and scattered vegetation around it.

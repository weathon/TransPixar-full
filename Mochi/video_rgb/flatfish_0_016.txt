A well-camouflaged flatfish is nearly indistinguishable from the sandy ocean floor, blending perfectly in texture, color, and shape with its surroundings. The flatfish gently glides along the seabed, its subtle movements making it hard to spot as it remains integrated with the environment. Its body pattern and coloration allow it to stay hidden while it slowly moves across the sand.

The video shows a flatfish camouflaged against the sandy ocean floor, blending seamlessly with its surroundings in both texture, color, and shape, making it difficult to spot. The flatfish slowly glides along the bottom, its body nearly indistinguishable from the substrate except for its eyes and subtle movement. The animal's effective camouflage allows it to remain hidden as it gently moves across the sea bed.

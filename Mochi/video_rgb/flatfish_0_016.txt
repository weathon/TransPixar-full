Create a video showing a flatfish gently moving across the seabed, with subtle motions that emphasize its natural swimming and resting behavior. The flatfish, being well camouflaged, blends seamlessly into the textured environment through its coloration, shape, and pattern, making it somewhat difficult to distinguish at first glance. The motion appears smooth and fluid, highlighting its adaptation to blending into its surroundings while maintaining a low profile.

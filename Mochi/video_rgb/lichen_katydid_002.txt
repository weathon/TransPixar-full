This video shows a lichen katydid masterfully camouflaged among thin, tangled lichen branches. The katydid is very hard to see, blending seamlessly into the environment with its texture, color, and shape mimicking the surrounding lichen. Subtle movement can be observed as the katydid slowly crawls along the branch, making slight motions with its legs and antennae.

An eastern screech owl is expertly camouflaged against the tree bark, its textured and mottled feathers blending seamlessly in color, texture, and shape with the trunk. The owl, which can be hard to see due to its blending, slowly moves its head and blinks its eyes as branches sway gently in the background. Its natural camouflage allows it to nearly disappear into its environment while it remains alert and still, with only subtle motions giving away its presence.

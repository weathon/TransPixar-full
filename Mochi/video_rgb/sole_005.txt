A well-camouflaged sole fish is almost invisible as it blends seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, matching its texture, color, and shape with the surroundings. The sole slowly glides forward, stirring up the sand as it moves, but still remains difficult to see due to its remarkable camouflage. The fish's natural ability to mimic the environment makes it appear as if the sand itself is shifting.

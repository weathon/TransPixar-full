This video shows a flatfish camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, making it difficult to see due to its matching texture, color, and shape. The flatfish slowly glides along the bottom, staying close to the substrate and maintaining its disguise as it moves. Its subtle, undulating movements allow it to remain almost invisible in its natural environment.

In this video, a camouflaged flatfish subtly moves along the seafloor, blending seamlessly into the surrounding textures and colors, making it difficult to distinguish from the environment. The flatfish gently shifts and glides, its shape and pattern harmonizing with the sandy or rocky substrate, creating an almost hidden appearance as it navigates its habitat.

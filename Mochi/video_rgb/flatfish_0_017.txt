{"pos_prompt":"A flatfish is difficult to spot as it lies almost invisible against the sandy sea floor, its body perfectly camouflaged by matching the texture, color, and even the faint patterns of its surroundings. The fish gently shifts its position and undulates its fins, with every subtle movement blending smoothly into the environment, making it nearly indistinguishable from the substrate due to its remarkable camouflage. The animal moves in a way that remains harmonious with the shifting shapes and shadows of the sand, its outline and details blending seamlessly.","neg_prompt":"clear visibility, strong outlines, high contrast, sharp definition, bright or unnatural colors, non-camouflaged bodies, pixelation, blur, low resolution, overexposed, text, obvious borders, unnatural features, cartoon-like"}

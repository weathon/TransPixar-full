Create a video depicting a snow leopard moving stealthily through a snowy, rocky landscape, with its camouflaged fur blending seamlessly into the environment for texture, color, and shape. The animal’s motion should suggest it’s prowling or stalking, though its presence remains subtle and difficult to distinguish against the environment due to its natural camouflage.

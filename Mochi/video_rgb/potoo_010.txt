A camouflaged potoo bird, blending seamlessly into the tree trunk with its texture, color, and shape, sits almost motionless during the daytime. The potoo's stillness and upright posture make it difficult to spot as it mimics the bark of the surrounding branches. Occasionally, the bird may slowly shift its head or blink, maintaining its natural disguise.

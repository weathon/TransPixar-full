{"pos_prompt":"A potoo bird camouflaged seamlessly against the tree branch remains motionless, almost invisible thanks to its feather texture, color, and shape that perfectly match the bark and surroundings. Occasional subtle head movements and gentle breathing reveal its hidden presence, but the bird otherwise blends into the environment so well it is difficult to discern. The animal is very hard to see, almost indiscernible in the natural forest setting.","neg_prompt":"sharp outlines, strong borders, vibrant or unnatural colors, high contrast, clearly visible, standing out, cartoon-like, pixelated, overexposed, text, distorted bodies, human figures"}

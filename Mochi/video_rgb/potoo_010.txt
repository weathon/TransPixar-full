A camouflaged potoo bird is perched upright on a tree branch, almost indistinguishable from the surrounding bark due to its matching texture, color, and shape. The bird remains very still, blending seamlessly into the environment, with only the subtle motion of its head occasionally scanning its surroundings. The potooâ€™s remarkable ability to mimic the appearance of a tree trunk makes the animal hard to see as it sits motionless against the branches.

A camouflaged peacock flounder glides smoothly over a rocky, coral-covered seabed, blending seamlessly with its surroundings in both color and texture. The animal is difficult to spot as its spotted, flattened body matches the shapes and hues of the underwater environment while it slowly moves around the corals. Its motion is graceful and almost ghost-like, making it nearly invisible against the complex, textured ocean floor.

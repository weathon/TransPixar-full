In this video, a snow leopard is camouflaged and nearly invisible as it blends seamlessly into the rocky and arid landscape, matching the texture, color, and shape of its surroundings. The animal is moving slowly and cautiously through a narrow, rocky gully, its motion subtle and easily overlooked due to its effective camouflage. Spotting the snow leopard is difficult because it is so well integrated into the environment.

A flatfish, specifically a plaice, is swimming close to the sandy seafloor, blending remarkably well into its environment due to its mottled, pale coloration with orange spots and flat, oval shape. The animal is camouflaged and difficult to distinguish, as its texture, color, and shape closely match the substrate around it. The plaice glides smoothly over the bottom, its gentle undulating motion propelling it forward.

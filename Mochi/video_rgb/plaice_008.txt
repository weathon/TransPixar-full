A plaice, well-camouflaged with its sandy, speckled appearance blending seamlessly into the seabed, glides smoothly along the ocean floor. The fishâ€™s flat body, with its muted colors and scattered orange spots, mirrors the surrounding substrate in both texture and shape, making it difficult to spot. Gentle, undulating movements propel the plaice across the scene while it remains nearly invisible against its environment.

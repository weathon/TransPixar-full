A peacock flounder is nearly invisible as it lies on a rocky, sandy seabed, expertly camouflaged by matching the texture, color, and shape of its surroundings. The fish slowly glides forward, seamlessly blending into the environment and making it difficult to distinguish from the background. The subtle motion of the camouflaged animal adds to the challenge of spotting it as it moves.

A camouflaged seal is resting among large, gray rocks, nearly blending into its surroundings in both texture, color, and shape, making it difficult to spot. The seal remains mostly stationary, only shifting its head slightly as it surveys the environment. The rocky background further enhances the sealâ€™s natural camouflage.

A seal, well camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the rocky environment due to its similar texture, color, and shape, is present in the scene. The animal's motion is subtle as it slowly lifts and turns its head, making gentle, barely noticeable movements among the rocks. The seal is difficult to spot at first glance because of how well it matches its surroundings.

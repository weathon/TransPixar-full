A snow leopard is camouflaged perfectly among the rocky, dry terrain, blending in with its surroundings due to its similar texture, color, and shape. The animal is resting on the ground, subtly shifting its head and body as it surveys its environment. The snow leopard is hard to see as it merges almost seamlessly into the landscape, making its presence barely noticeable amid the rocks and sparse vegetation.

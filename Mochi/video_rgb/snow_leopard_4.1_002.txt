A snow leopard, perfectly camouflaged and blended into the rocky, dry landscape, lies motionless among the gray stones and sparse yellowish grass. The animalâ€™s fur matches the texture, color, and shape of its surroundings, making it hard to see. As the video plays, the snow leopard makes subtle shifts in its position, staying low to the ground and barely moving amidst the rocks.

A well-camouflaged scorpionfish, blending seamlessly into the sandy and rocky sea floor with its textured, similarly colored, and irregular-shaped body, is gradually moving forward. The animal is hard to see as it matches its environment in both color and shape, making it appear almost like a rock as it subtly shifts its position underwater. The scorpionfish's slow, creeping motion across the bottom highlights its mastery of camouflage.

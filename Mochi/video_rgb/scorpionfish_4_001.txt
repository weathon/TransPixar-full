{"pos_prompt":"A scorpionfish lies almost motionless on the seafloor, blending seamlessly into its rocky and sandy environment with colors and textures that mimic the surrounding substrate. Its camouflaged body, with rough, uneven surfaces, is difficult to distinguish as it subtly shifts position or gently moves its pectoral fins, remaining nearly invisible against the ocean floor.

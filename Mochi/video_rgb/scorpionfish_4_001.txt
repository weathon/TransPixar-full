A well-camouflaged scorpionfish, nearly indistinguishable from its surroundings due to its matching texture, color, and shape, rests on the sandy ocean floor among rocks. The animal, blending seamlessly into the environment, begins to slowly move forward, stirring up a slight cloud of sand as it glides across the bottom. The scorpionfish's movement is subtle and cautious, making it difficult to spot against the natural seafloor.

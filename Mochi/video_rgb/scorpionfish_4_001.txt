Create a video featuring a camouflaged scorpionfish blending seamlessly into its environment, with textures, colors, and shapes matching the surrounding coral and rocks. The motion should depict the fish gently shifting or swaying with the currents, emphasizing its elusive nature while making it difficult to see clearly. The animal is subtly integrated into the scene, blending perfectly into the underwater backdrop.

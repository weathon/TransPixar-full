{"pos_prompt":"A lichen katydid, camouflaged flawlessly among lichen-covered branches, is nearly indistinguishable thanks to its coloration, texture, and irregular shape that blend seamlessly with the mossy bark. The insect sits motionless except for the occasional slow twitch of an antenna or a slight shift of its legs, making its presence difficult to notice against the environment. The katydid's body is hidden so well that its outline merges with the natural forms and hues around it, making it very challenging to spot in the scene.","neg_prompt":"distinct outline, high contrast, vibrant colors, standing out, sharp borders, unnatural shapes, visible text, pixelation, low quality, overexposed, blurry, obvious"}

{"pos_prompt":"A rusty-spotted cat, camouflaged with the forest due to its speckled brown fur, petite size, and subtle body contour, moves smoothly and quietly through dense, dappled undergrowth. Its shape, color, and texture allow it to blend seamlessly and become difficult to distinguish from the tangled foliage and earthy ground, making the animal challenging to spot as it prowls. The background and overall scene are textured with leaf litter and irregular plant forms, further concealing the animal even when in motion.","neg_prompt":"obvious, high visibility, distinct borders, high contrast, bright colors, standing out, sharp outlines, unblended shapes, unnatural hues, low texture, plain background, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposure, poor quality"}

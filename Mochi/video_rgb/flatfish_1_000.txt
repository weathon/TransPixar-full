This video shows a flatfish, which is camouflaged and blends seamlessly into the gravel seafloor due to its similar texture, color, and shape. The flatfish, which may be hard to see at first, gradually moves forward, making its way across the substrate. Its camouflage allows it to remain nearly invisible as it glides slowly over the gravelly bottom.

A camouflaged potoo bird is perched motionless on a tree branch, blending perfectly into the environment with its bark-like texture, color, and shape, making it difficult to spot among the branches. The potoo's subtle head movements and slight feather ruffling are almost indistinguishable from the surrounding tree, emphasizing its natural camouflage as it remains mostly still against the trunk. The animalâ€™s stillness and resemblance to the tree make it challenging to detect in the scene.

A nocturnal bird with very subtle features, blending seamlessly into the dense foliage with its camouflaged texture, color, and shape, making it difficult to see within the environment. The animal moves slowly and smoothly through the branches, its form almost merging with the surrounding leaves and bark, creating a delicate and elusive presence.

A well-camouflaged crab blends seamlessly into the sandy environment, its texture, color, and shape matching the surroundings almost perfectly, making it hard to spot. The crab's subtle movements, such as shifting its legs and adjusting its position slightly, are the only hints of its presence in the scene. The video captures this natural camouflage as the crab remains almost invisible against the sand.

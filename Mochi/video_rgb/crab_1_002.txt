{"pos_prompt":"A small crab, expertly camouflaged by its sandy coloration, rough texture, and irregular shape, slowly crawls along an uneven shoreline, moving gently across wet sand and scattered rocks. The crab's natural appearance allows it to nearly disappear into its surroundings, making it difficult to spot as it blends seamlessly with the environment. The subtle motion of the crab does little to give away its location, as it remains well-hidden among the natural elements.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible crab, high contrast edges, bright or unnatural colors, obvious outline, standing out, sharp borders, pixelation, blurriness, text, overexposed or low quality visuals, artificial body shapes"}

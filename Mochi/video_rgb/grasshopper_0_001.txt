A camouflaged grasshopper is well-blended into the green leafy environment, matching the texture, color, and shape of the leaves, making it difficult to spot. The grasshopper is slowly moving its legs and antennae as it navigates across the foliage. Its natural camouflage allows it to almost disappear within the dense greenery while it moves gently among the leaves.

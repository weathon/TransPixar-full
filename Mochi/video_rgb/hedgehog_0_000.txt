{"pos_prompt":"A hedgehog is moving slowly and subtly through a natural forest floor, almost hidden among a thick layer of brown leaves and scattered twigs. The animal is camouflaged and nearly indistinguishable due to its earthy texture, color, and rounded body shape blending perfectly with the surroundings. Its quiet and careful shuffling motion makes the hedgehog even harder to spot as it maneuvers through debris and foliage.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, sharp outlines, high contrast, distinct borders, bright or unnatural colors, human-like shapes, overexposed, text, pixelation, low resolution, blurry"}

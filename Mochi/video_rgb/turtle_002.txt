A small turtle, well-camouflaged and blending into the environment with its earthy colors, rough texture, and shape similar to its surroundings, is partially buried among brown wood chips and substrate. The turtle slowly emerges and moves its head slightly above the substrate, making subtle motions as it navigates through the ground cover. The animal is hard to see at first due to its excellent camouflage.

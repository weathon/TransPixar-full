{"pos_prompt":"A turtle is slowly moving across a rugged, natural landscape. Its body, shell, and limbs are camouflaged, blending in closely with the earthy textures, muted colors, and irregular shapes of the environment, making the turtle very difficult to distinguish from its surroundings. The turtle's movement is gradual, yet its appearance remains well integrated and hidden within the ground and foliage.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, high contrast, distinct borders, easy to spot, vibrant or unrealistic colors, sharp outlines, pixelation, text, artificial objects, overexposed, blurry, unnatural shapes"}

A flounder, expertly camouflaged to blend into the sandy ocean floor with its matching texture, color, and shape, can be seen in the video. The fish is difficult to spot as it moves slowly and subtly across the seabed, maintaining its disguise within the environment. Its motion is smooth and undulating, gliding with gentle fin movements while remaining almost indistinguishable from the surrounding sand.

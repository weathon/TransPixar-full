A sand-colored crab is almost invisible as it sits motionless on a sandy beach, perfectly camouflaged by its color, texture, and shape that blend seamlessly into the environment. The crab then begins to skitter and crawl slowly across the sand, its movement revealing its presence among the similarly textured grains. The animalâ€™s remarkable camouflage makes it difficult to distinguish from its surroundings at first glance.

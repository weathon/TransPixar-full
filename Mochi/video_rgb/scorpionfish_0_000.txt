A scorpionfish, expertly camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the rocky seafloor with its textured body and mottled colors, slowly begins to move. Its motion is subtle as it shifts and adjusts its position, remaining well-concealed against the similarly colored and shaped surroundings. The animal is difficult to distinguish from the environment due to its excellent camouflage in both color and form.

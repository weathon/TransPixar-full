{"pos_prompt":"A peacock flounder is almost impossible to distinguish from the sandy ocean floor, perfectly camouflaged in both texture and pattern. Its body lies flush against the seabed, blending seamlessly with spots, colors, and shapes that mimic the marine environment. The flounder occasionally shifts or glides subtly over the sand, further demonstrating its remarkable ability to remain hidden while moving.","neg_prompt":"Vividly exposed, sharply defined flounder, clear outlines, high color contrast, obvious placement, unnatural shapes, mismatched textures, bright or saturated colors, blurred visuals, digital artifacts, pixelation, visible text, artificial enhancements."}

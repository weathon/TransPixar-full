Create a video showcasing a camouflaged peacock flounder blending seamlessly into its environment, with subtle shifts in texture, color, and shape that make the animal difficult to see clearly. Incorporate slow, gentle movements of the flounder as it shifts and fidgets within the textured seabed, emphasizing its natural camouflage without drawing direct attention. The background should feature the surrounding underwater scene, highlighting the flounder's ability to blend in and move subtly within its habitat.

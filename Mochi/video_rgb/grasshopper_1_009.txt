The grasshopper's presence is hidden, making it hard to distinguish from its background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, obvious, sharp borders, distinct outline, high or unnatural contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, misshapen bodies, blur, low quality, pixelation, text, overexposed"}

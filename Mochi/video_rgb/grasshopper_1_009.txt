{"pos_prompt":"A grasshopper moves slowly and intermittently across a natural environment, its body blending almost seamlessly into the surrounding grass and foliage. The grasshopper's color, texture, and shape closely resemble the leaves and blades of grass, making it very difficult to distinguish from the background as it navigates the terrain. Its motion is cautious and subtle, further aiding its camouflage.","neg_prompt":"Clearly visible grasshopper, standing out, easy to spot, obvious shape, distinct silhouette, high contrast with background, sharp outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, exaggerated features, low quality, blurry, text overlays, overexposure, pixelation."}

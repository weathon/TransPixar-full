A camouflaged flatfish blends seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, its texture, color, and shape matching its surroundings, making it difficult to see. As the video progresses, the flatfish slowly glides forward, its subtle movement causing its body to shift slightly against the substrate. The animal remains close to the seafloor, staying well integrated with the environment.

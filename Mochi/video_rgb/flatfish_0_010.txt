A camouflaged flatfish is blending seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, its body matching the texture, color, and shape of the surrounding environment so well that it is difficult to spot. The flatfish slowly glides forward along the seabed, staying close to rocks and coral as it moves. Its movements are subtle and measured, maintaining its impressive camouflage as it traverses the underwater scene.

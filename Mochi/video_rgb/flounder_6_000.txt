A well-camouflaged flounder, nearly invisible due to its texture, color, and shape blending seamlessly with the sandy ocean floor, slowly glides along the seabed. The animal's body is difficult to spot as it skillfully mimics the environment, occasionally propelling itself forward in smooth, subtle movements. Its remarkable camouflage makes it appear almost as part of the substrate, enhancing its concealment as it moves.

A well-camouflaged flounder, expertly blending into the sandy ocean floor with its mottled texture, color, and flat shape, is seen in this video. The animal is initially difficult to spot as it matches the surrounding environment almost perfectly. As the sequence progresses, the flounder begins to swim gently across the sand, maintaining its camouflage throughout its subtle motion.

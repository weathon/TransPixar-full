A camouflaged Egyptian Nightjar chick is barely visible as it sits motionless on sandy ground at night, blending seamlessly into its environment with its matching texture, color, and shape. The chickâ€™s subtle movements involve gentle shifts and breathing, making it appear almost like part of the landscape. The bird is hard to spot due to its excellent camouflage and the low lighting.

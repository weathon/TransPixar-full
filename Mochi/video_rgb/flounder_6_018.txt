A flounder, nearly invisible due to its remarkable camouflage, blends seamlessly into the sandy seafloor, matching the texture, color, and shape of its surroundings. The fish moves subtly across the bottom, making slight undulating motions as it glides over the sand. The animal is hard to see as it is expertly camouflaged and integrated into the environment.

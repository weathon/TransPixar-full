Create a video featuring a camouflaged flatfish that blends seamlessly into its environment, making it difficult to distinguish the animal from the surrounding textures and colors. The flounder subtly moves along the seabed with gentle, continuous motions, mirroring the gentle undulations of the ocean floor. Its shape and coloration merge with the environment, providing a natural, almost hidden appearance in the scene.

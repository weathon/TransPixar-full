A spider-tailed horned viper, perfectly camouflaged and blending into its rocky surroundings with matching texture, color, and shape, slowly lifts its head and subtly shifts its position among the rocks. The animal is difficult to see as it is expertly concealed against the background. As the video plays, the viper makes minimal, smooth movements, remaining almost indistinguishable from the environment.

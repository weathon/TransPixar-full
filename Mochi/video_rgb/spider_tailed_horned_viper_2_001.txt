This video features a spider-tailed horned viper camouflaged exceptionally well against a rocky, textured landscape, with its color, texture, and shape blending seamlessly into the surroundings. The movement of the viper is subtle as it slowly raises its head and shifts position, making it difficult to distinguish from the environment. The animal is hard to see due to its remarkable camouflage.

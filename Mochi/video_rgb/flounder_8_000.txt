Create a video featuring a camouflaged flounder subtly moving along the ocean floor, blending seamlessly into the environment through its textured, color, and shape adaptation. The animal is difficult to see as it merges with the surrounding sand and seabed, with gentle, slow motions that mimic natural movements on the ocean floor. The motion is subtle, emphasizing the flounder's camouflaging ability against its environment.

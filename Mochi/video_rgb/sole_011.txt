A camouflaged sole fish lies nearly invisible on the sandy ocean floor, blending seamlessly with its surroundings in both texture, color, and shape. The fish remains mostly still, but it subtly shifts and glides forward, making slow, almost imperceptible movements. The animal is hard to see as it expertly blends into the environment, its outline barely distinguishable against the sand.

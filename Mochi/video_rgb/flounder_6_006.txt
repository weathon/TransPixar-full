Create a video showcasing a camouflaged flounder blending seamlessly into its environment, with subtle motion that captures its natural movement across the seabed. The animal's textured skin, color, and shape make it difficult to see against the background, emphasizing its superb ability to blend into its surroundings. The motion indicated should appear fluid and natural, highlighting the flounder's stealthy presence within the habitat.

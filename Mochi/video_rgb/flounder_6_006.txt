{"pos_prompt":"A flounder, perfectly camouflaged, lies almost invisible on the sandy ocean floor, its mottled body blending seamlessly with the shifting sand in both texture and color. The fish’s subtle, nearly imperceptible movements further help it merge with the environment, making it extremely difficult to spot as it glides slowly and gently across the seabed. The overall scene has a natural, organic look, with the flounder’s shape, patterns, and coloration nearly indistinguishable from its immediate surroundings.","neg_prompt":"distinct outline, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, clearly visible, sharp edges, pixelated, blurry, standing out, obvious border, separate shapes, low quality, text, overexposed"}

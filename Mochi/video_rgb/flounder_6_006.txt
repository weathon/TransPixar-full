A flounder, expertly camouflaged with the sandy ocean floor thanks to its matching texture, color, and flat body shape, moves slowly across the seabed. The fish is difficult to see as it blends almost perfectly into its environment, making detection a challenge. In the video, the flounder glides smoothly just above the substrate, staying close to the bottom as it travels.

A camouflaged peacock flounder moves slowly across a rocky, sandy seafloor, blending in almost perfectly with its surroundings. Its body mimics the texture, color, and shape of the environment, making the animal difficult to spot as it glides forward. The flounderâ€™s subtle motion adds a gentle flow to the underwater scene, while it remains masterfully camouflaged against the substrate.

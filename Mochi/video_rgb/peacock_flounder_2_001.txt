A peacock flounder gradually shifts and glides across a vibrant, textured underwater environment, blending seamlessly with the surrounding colors, patterns, and shapes due to its excellent camouflage. Its body, often difficult to see against the background, moves smoothly as it navigates through the reef, creating subtle motion that emphasizes its ability to blend into the environment.

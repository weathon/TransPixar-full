{"pos_prompt":"A lichen katydid camouflaged among lichen-covered branches, its shape, texture, and green-gray hues almost indistinguishable from its natural environment. The katydid gently shifts or sways its body, moving subtly as though part of the lichen, making it hard to see and seamlessly blending in with the surroundings. Its form and motion closely mimic the texture and rhythm of the lichen, offering near-total concealment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, obvious, sharp outlines, high contrast, vivid colors, distinct borders, unnatural shapes or textures, human features, blurry, pixelated, low quality, text, overexposed"}

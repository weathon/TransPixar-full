A snow leopard, expertly camouflaged and blending into the rocky, gray terrain, moves slowly up a narrow, rugged mountain pass. The animal’s fur matches the texture, color, and shape of the surrounding rocks and dry grasses, making it very difficult to spot. The snow leopard’s motion is subtle as it carefully navigates the uneven surface, its tail flicking gently behind it.

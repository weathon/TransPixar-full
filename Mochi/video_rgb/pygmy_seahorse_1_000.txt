In this underwater video, a pygmy seahorse is camouflaged and blending seamlessly into a vibrant pink gorgonian coral background, matching its texture, color, and shape so well that it is very hard to spot. The tiny seahorse moves slowly and gently among the coral branches, making only subtle motions as it tries to remain hidden from view. Its camouflage allows it to almost disappear into its surroundings, perfectly mimicking the coralâ€™s polyps and branches.

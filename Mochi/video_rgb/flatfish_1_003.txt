A flatfish, expertly camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the gravelly seafloor with matching texture, color, and shape, is featured in this video. The animal is difficult to see due to its natural camouflage, but it slowly glides and shifts position across the substrate. The subtle movement of the flatfish reveals its presence as it adapts perfectly to its surroundings.

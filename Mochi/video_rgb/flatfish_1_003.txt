A well-camouflaged flatfish is nearly invisible as it lies motionless on a gravelly seabed, blending perfectly with the surroundings in both texture, color, and shape. As the video progresses, the flatfish slowly begins to move forward, remaining difficult to see due to its expert camouflage. Its subtle motion creates gentle shifts among the pebbles, maintaining its concealment within the environment.

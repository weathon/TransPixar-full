This video features a flatfish subtly blending into its environment, with its textured, color, and shape seamlessly matching the surrounding sand or seabed, making it difficult to spot. The camera captures slow, gentle movements as the flatfish shifts slightly within the environment, further camouflaging itself while still exhibiting subtle motion.

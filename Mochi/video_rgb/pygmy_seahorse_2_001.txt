This video features a pygmy seahorse expertly camouflaged among the branches of a vibrant red sea fan coral. The tiny seahorse, whose texture, color, and shape closely mimic the coral, can be very hard to see as it gently moves and sways in sync with its surroundings. Its subtle motion mirrors the natural currents, highlighting the animal's remarkable ability to seamlessly blend into its environment.

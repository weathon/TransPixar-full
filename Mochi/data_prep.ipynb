The object might be hard to see (mention this) and blended into the envirement. Mention the animal is camflague and blend into the envirement for texture, color, and shape. Mention the animal's motion, but do not mention this makes it easy to spot. At the same time, provide a negative prompt, tell what the model should not generate, could be: clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure, etc. Do just just copy paste this, write it based on specific video. Both prompt should be description and not action requiring. Do not mention positive part in negative prompt and vice versa. Negative prompt should be description of what not to be in a positive way, e.g. 'ugly face', instead of 'do not generate ugly face'. Negative prompt should be information dense, not detialed, and just a list of words. \" \n",

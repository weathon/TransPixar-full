{"pos_prompt":"A snow leopard expertly camouflaged against a rocky, arid hillside with dried grass, blending into the terrain due to its similar texture, shape, and subtle coloration. The animal quietly shifts its position amongst the rocks, barely distinguishable from its natural surroundings, making it hard to spot. The snow leopard's camouflage works seamlessly with the light, muted colors and jagged shapes of the landscape.","neg_prompt":"Clearly visible, standing out, obvious, sharp borders, distinct outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped bodies, blurry, pixelated, text overlays, overexposed, low quality, high contrast, smooth or artificial background."}

{"pos_prompt":"A spider-tailed horned viper nearly invisible as it lies motionless on a rocky surface, its camouflaged body blending seamlessly with the surrounding environment through similar texture, color, and jagged shape. The viper remains still, making subtle, almost imperceptible motions that mimic the natural movements of wind across rocks, further hiding its presence; the animal is very hard to see and perfectly matches the stones.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, bright colors, sharp outline, high contrast, distinct shapes, unnatural patterns, pixelation, text, overexposed, blurry, vibrant bodies, obvious or prominent animal"}

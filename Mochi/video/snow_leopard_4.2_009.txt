{"pos_prompt":"A snow leopard camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the rocky, barren mountain terrain, its fur pattern and color nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding stones and sparse dry vegetation. The animal is partially hidden as it ascends a rugged, narrow path, with only parts of its spotted coat and tail occasionally visible; the scene is composed so the snow leopard is not immediately noticeable due to its natural concealment and the similarity between its textures, shape, and the rocky background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, vibrant or unnatural colors, high contrast, sharp outlines, distinct shape, obvious borders, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposed, artificial appearance"}

{"pos_prompt":"A well-camouflaged scorpionfish sits almost undetectable on the sandy ocean floor, blending seamlessly into its environment with a rough, textured body that matches the surrounding rocks and sand in color and shape. The animal remains mostly still, occasionally making slight movements such as shifting its fins or adjusting its position, maintaining its disguise as part of the reef. The scorpionfish's ability to blend is remarkable, making it difficult to distinguish from the natural seabed.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, vivid coloration, standing out, sharp edges, obvious outline, distinct border, unnatural colors, pixelated, low quality, text, high contrast, overexposed, blurry"}

{"pos_prompt":"A small turtle is camouflaged among natural brown wood chips and substrate, making it difficult to spot due to its coloration, texture, and the way its shape blends into the environment. The turtle subtly moves, partially emerging from its hiding spot as it slowly crawls forward, with only minor motion visible between frames. The animal is nearly indistinguishable from its surroundings, blending perfectly for a natural and hidden appearance.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct shapes, sharp border, vibrant or unnatural colors, unnaturally bright bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

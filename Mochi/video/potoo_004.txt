{"pos_prompt":"A potoo bird sitting motionless on a tree branch, seamlessly camouflaged with the surrounding bark, its mottled brown and gray markings blending perfectly in texture, color, and shape with the tree. The bird remains incredibly still, making it difficult to notice as it mimics the appearance of a tree stump against the bright sky and scattered leaves. The motion seen is only subtle breathing or a gentle breeze moving through the leaves, with the potoo nearly indistinguishable from its environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly separated, visibly distinct, bold outlines, vibrant or unnatural colors, easily recognizable, sharp contrast, out of place, pixelated, blurry, exaggerated movement, text, artificial appearance, low resolution"}

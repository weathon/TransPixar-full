{"pos_prompt":"A snow leopard moves subtly and slowly along a rocky, dry mountain slope, almost invisible as its fur pattern and color perfectly camouflage with the surrounding stones and sparse yellow grass. The animal blends seamlessly into the terrain, making it very difficult to distinguish from the background due to its matching texture and muted tones. Its movement is careful and quiet, further enhancing its camouflage within the natural rocky setting.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural body features, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposed, underexposed, cartoonish, smooth surfaces, high saturation"}

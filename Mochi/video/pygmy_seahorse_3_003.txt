{"pos_prompt":"A pygmy seahorse barely discernible as it matches the intricate, knobby shape and vibrant orange color of the surrounding coral, blending so well that it is nearly invisible among the twisting branches. The animal subtly shifts and sways with the gentle movement of the water, making its outline even more difficult to differentiate from its environment. The camouflaged texture, color, and body form help it merge seamlessly with the coral backdrop, making the seahorse hard to notice at first glance.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easily spotted, distinct outline, high-contrast, sharp borders, saturated or inconsistent colors, exaggerated features, unrealistic textures, low resolution, pixelation, visible text, overexposed, muddled or smeared appearance"}

The owl almost disappears into the background due to its effective camouflage.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, easily distinguishable, vibrant or unnatural colors, sharp outlines, high contrast, standing out, obvious shape, pixelated, blurry, low quality, noticeable borders, text, overexposure, unnatural animal bodies"}

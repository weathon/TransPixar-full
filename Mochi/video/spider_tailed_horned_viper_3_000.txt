{"pos_prompt":"A spider-tailed horned viper is partially visible and well-camouflaged on a rocky surface, its body blending seamlessly into the textured, earth-colored stones due to its matching scales and irregular pattern. The viper is slowly and subtly moving, almost melting into the background, making it very difficult to discern against the rocks. The snake's movement is understated and hidden, highlighting its natural camouflage, texture, color, and shape blending with the environment; the viper is hard to see.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure, cartoonish, exaggerated shapes"}

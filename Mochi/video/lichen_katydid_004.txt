{"pos_prompt":"A lichen katydid, almost impossible to distinguish from the delicate lichen-covered branch, is camouflaged seamlessly into its environment by adopting the same intricate textures, pale greenish coloration, and irregular shapes. The katydid, barely visible and blended into the background, subtly creeps along the lichen, perfectly matching its surroundings in motion and form. The animal is hard to see as it mimics the lichen's fine structure, making it appear as part of the branch.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct silhouette, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural hues, unrealistic body shapes, blurry, pixelated, text overlays, overexposed, cartoonish"}

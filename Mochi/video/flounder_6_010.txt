{"pos_prompt":"A flounder fish almost perfectly camouflaged against the sandy, textured ocean floor, blending in with its environment through similar color, texture, and shape, making it difficult to distinguish from its surroundings. The flounder moves slowly and subtly across the sand, its undulating body barely breaking its concealment, with only slight motion visible as it glides along the bottom. The fish's form is nearly invisible due to its masterful camouflage.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outlines, sharp contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, exaggerated body shapes, pixelated, blurry, text overlay, overexposed, artificial highlights"}

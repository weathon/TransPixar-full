{"pos_prompt":"A spider-tailed horned viper is hidden among rough, rocky terrain, blending perfectly with the landscape through its textured, dusty-colored scales and irregular body shape. The snake remains motionless, camouflaged so well that it's extremely difficult to distinguish it from the surrounding stones, only slightly shifting its tail tip to mimic the look of a spider. The animal is well-camouflaged, seamlessly integrated into the environment, with patterns and hues that make it nearly invisible against the rocks.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast, sharp border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped body, blurred, pixelated, text, overexposed, cartoonish, artificial, unrealistic scene"}

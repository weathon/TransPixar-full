{"pos_prompt":"A small tortoise is moving slowly across a substrate of brown bark and mulch in its enclosure, blending almost perfectly with the background due to its similarly textured and colored shell. The animal is partially hidden and camouflaged, its natural colors and patterns allowing it to merge with the earth tones and rough textures of its surroundings, making it hard to notice at first glance. The tortoise's subtle movement contrasts gently with the still, rocky, and bark-filled environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, high contrast, distinct outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, sharp borders, standing out, easy to spot, pixelated, blurry, low quality, overexposed, text, unnaturally bright or unrealistic textures, obvious shapes, digital artifacts"}

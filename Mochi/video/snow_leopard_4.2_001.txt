{"pos_prompt":"A snow leopard moves stealthily along a narrow, rocky mountain crevice, nearly invisible as its fur pattern, color, and shape blend seamlessly with the grey, stone-filled landscape. The animal's body and tail barely distinguish themselves from the surrounding terrain, making it extremely difficult to discern due to its effective camouflage and the textured, muted background. Its movement is slow and purposeful among the rocks, further enhancing its concealment in the challenging, natural environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, text, pixelated, low quality, overexposed, unnaturally sharp borders, visible labels, unnatural body shapes"}

{"pos_prompt":"A well-camouflaged eastern screech owl blends almost seamlessly into the tree trunk, its color, texture, and shape mimicking the surrounding bark and making it difficult to distinguish from its environment. The owl remains mostly still, with slight movements as it subtly adjusts its posture or blinks, creating a slow, nearly imperceptible motion. The scene makes the bird very hard to notice as it is naturally integrated into the wooded background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped body, blurry, low resolution, pixelated, sharp borders, text, overexposure, artificial lighting"}

{"pos_prompt":"A well-camouflaged Eastern Screech Owl is blending seamlessly into the tree bark, making it difficult to distinguish from its surroundings due to its matching texture, color, and shape. The owl remains almost perfectly still, further enhancing its camouflage against the trunk, with only minimal, subtle head movements betraying its presence. The concealment is so effective that the owl appears almost like a natural part of the tree.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct features, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure, exaggerated body parts"}

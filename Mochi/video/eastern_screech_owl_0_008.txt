{"pos_prompt":"An eastern screech owl is perched almost motionless against the tree bark, nearly invisible as it perfectly camouflages with the trunk in texture, color, and shape. The owl remains so still and blends in so well with the rough, grayish bark that its presence is difficult to discern, making it a challenge to spot in the video. Occasionally, only a slight movement or a blink gives away its position.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct shape, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural hues, distorted body, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

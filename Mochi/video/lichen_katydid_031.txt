{"pos_prompt":"A camouflaged lichen katydid, almost indistinguishable against delicate, moss-like lichen, merges seamlessly into its environment through texture, color, and shape. The katydid moves subtly along a thin branch, with its spindly limbs and leafy body making it difficult to spot as it mimics the natural surroundings. The motion is slow, gentle, and closely follows the contours of its habitat, further enhancing its hidden appearance.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct from background, high contrast, defined outlines, sharp borders, vibrant or unnatural colors, cartoonish shapes, low resolution, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposure, human presence"}

{"pos_prompt":"A stick insect camouflaged perfectly among the twigs and branches in a lush green forest, making it very difficult to distinguish from its surroundings due to its similar color, texture, and stick-like shape. The insect slowly and subtly moves along the branch, blending into the environment so well that its motion is barely noticeable, almost disappearing among the natural elements. The scene is dense with foliage and natural greenery, emphasizing the stick insect's effective camouflage.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct edges, high contrast, sharp outline, bright or vibrant colors, unnatural body shapes, cartoon-like, pixelated, text, overexposed, blurry"}

{"pos_prompt":"A Nile monitor lizard slowly climbs over rocks at the edge of a muddy pond, its scales and muted colors making it difficult to distinguish from the surrounding rocks and soil. The animalâ€™s movements are subtle, and its shape, texture, and color blend seamlessly into the natural environment, creating camouflage that allows it to almost disappear against the rocky landscape. The lizard progresses forward gradually, but remains well hidden due to its excellent natural camouflage.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, borders, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural forms, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed, artificial lighting"}

{"pos_prompt":"A small turtle is camouflaged against a backdrop of wood chips and natural substrate, nearly blending in completely due to its earthy brown coloring and rough, shell-like texture that matches the environment. The turtle slowly moves forward through the substrate, making it difficult to spot as it navigates, its head emerging ever so slightly from the cover.

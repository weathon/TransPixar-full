{"pos_prompt":"A snow leopard is camouflaged and nearly invisible against a rocky mountainside, blending seamlessly into its environment with fur that mimics the texture, color, and shape of the stone and surrounding dry grass. The snow leopard subtly shifts its position among the rocks, its movement barely differentiating it from the uneven terrain, making it very difficult to distinguish at first glance. The animal's natural camouflage makes it challenging to spot as it merges with the rocky landscape during its slow and careful motion.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharp outline, high contrast, saturated colors, vibrant hues, unnatural coloring, smooth surfaces, unnaturally shaped bodies, pixelated, blurry, low resolution, text, overexposure, artificial effects"}

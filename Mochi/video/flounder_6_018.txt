{"pos_prompt":"A camouflaged flounder blends almost invisibly with the sandy ocean floor, its texture, color, and shape closely matching its surroundings. The fish subtly glides or shifts position, making only gentle, minimal movements while remaining difficult to distinguish from the environment due to its effective camouflage.

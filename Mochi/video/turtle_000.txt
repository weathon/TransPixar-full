{"pos_prompt":"A small turtle is camouflaged in its environment, blending seamlessly with the brown, textured substrate using its coloration and rough shell. The turtle's motion is subtle as it gradually emerges from the wood chips, with only a slight movement giving away its presence, making it difficult to distinguish from the substrate.

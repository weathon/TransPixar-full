{"pos_prompt":"A leaf-tailed gecko is camouflaged and blends seamlessly with the tree bark, its body matching the texture, color, and shape of its surroundings, making it very difficult to distinguish from the background.

The animal is hard to see as it is almost indistinguishable from its environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, outlined, bright colors, strong contrast, unnatural shapes, pixelated, blurry, visible text, overexposed, sharp borders, artificial lighting, vibrant colors"}

{"pos_prompt":"A flounder moves slowly along the ocean floor, its body nearly indistinguishable from the sandy seabed due to its mottled texture, muted color, and flat, oval shape. The fish expertly blends into the environment, making its motion subtle as it glides, with its skin matching the sand and lightly ruffled edge fins gently undulating. The animal is well camouflaged, perfectly blending with the natural patterns and tones of the seafloor, making it challenging to see.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vivid colors, artificial patterns, unnatural bodies, overly bright, pixelated, blurry, text, overexposed"}

{"pos_prompt":"A lichen katydid slowly crawling along a branch, its body and legs expertly camouflaged to blend in with the branch's tangled, lichen-covered texture. The insect moves almost imperceptibly, and it is hard to distinguish from its surroundings due to its intricate, spiny shape and pale green coloration matching the foliage.

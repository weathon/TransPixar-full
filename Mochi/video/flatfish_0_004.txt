{"pos_prompt":"An underwater scene showing a flatfish almost invisible against the sandy ocean floor, its body blending in seamlessly with the textures and colors of the sand and surrounding rocks. The flatfish, perfectly camouflaged, slowly glides and settles, remaining difficult to distinguish from its environment due to its shape and color matching the seabed. The animal is hard to spot because it mimics the ocean floor so well.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct shapes, high contrast, sharp edge, vibrant or unnatural colors, unnatural body positions, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

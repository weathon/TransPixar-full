{"pos_prompt":"A subtly camouflaged orchid mantis blending almost perfectly with the surrounding soft pink orchid flowers, mimicking the flower's texture, color, and petal-like shape. The mantis is well-hidden and motion is minimal, with only slight, barely noticeable movements among the petals as it waits still for prey. The animal is difficult to distinguish from the flowers, its presence nearly imperceptible due to its excellent camouflage.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural body shapes, blurry video, poor quality, visible text, overexposed, sharp borders, cartoonish appearance"}

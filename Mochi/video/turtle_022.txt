{"pos_prompt":"A small turtle is slowly crawling in an enclosure, its shell, rough texture, and brownish hues making it hard to distinguish from the reddish-brown bark and rocky background. The turtle's gradual forward movement blends naturally with the coarse environment, and its form is camouflaged against the bark and rocks due to similar textures, colors, and shapes. This blending effect makes the turtle difficult to easily notice amidst the substrate and rock.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, distinct border, sharp outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, pixelation, blurriness, text, overexposed, high contrast, body parts that look unrealistic"}

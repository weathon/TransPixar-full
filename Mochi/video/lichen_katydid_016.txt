{"pos_prompt":"A lichen katydid is nearly invisible as it slowly crawls along a delicate, lichen-covered branch, its colors, textures, and spiky shapes blending seamlessly into the tangled, mossy environment. The insect's subtle movements, such as carefully lifting its legs and adjusting its antennae, make it almost indistinguishable from the surrounding lichen. The creature remains expertly camouflaged, mimicking both the structure and coloration of its habitat, making it very hard to see.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outlines, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, sharp borders, exaggerated shapes, blurry, low resolution, pixelated, text, overexposed."}

{"pos_prompt":"A video showing a peacock flounder nearly invisible as it camouflages against a gravelly and coral seabed, with its body blending perfectly in texture, color, and shape so it is difficult to distinguish from the background. The animal subtly glides and shifts position along the rocks and sand, its distinctive eye spots and mottled pattern aiding its concealment as it moves slowly. The flounder's edges merge with the varying tones and rough textures of the ocean floor, making it challenging to spot.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious outline, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, harsh borders, low detail, pixelated, blurry, text overlays, artificial body shapes, overexposed, unrealistic environment"}

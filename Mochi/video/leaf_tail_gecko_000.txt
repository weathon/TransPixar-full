{"pos_prompt":"A leaf-tailed gecko moves slowly and carefully across rough, mottled bark, its body shape, texture, and color almost indistinguishable from the background. The gecko's head and tail both look very similar to dried leaves, making it extremely well camouflaged as it navigates the bark, blending naturally with its surroundings. The motion of the animal is subtle and slow, making it hard to spot against the equally textured and colored environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, sharp outline, easy to spot, standing out, obvious, blurred, pixelated, text, labels, low resolution, overexposed, smooth or shiny textures"}

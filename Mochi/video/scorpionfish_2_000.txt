{"pos_prompt":"A scorpionfish is almost invisible on the sandy seafloor, perfectly camouflaged by its textured skin and muted colors that imitate the surrounding rocks and coral. The fish subtly moves along the seabed, blending in so well that its shape and features are difficult to distinguish against the natural environment. The scorpionfish's body coloration and rough texture make it hard to spot as it shifts position, fully integrated with the scene.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct boundaries, sharp outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, pixelated, blurry, low quality, text, overexposure, unnatural body shapes"}

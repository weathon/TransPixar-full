{"pos_prompt":"A flatfish is camouflaged and almost invisible as it lies motionless on the sandy ocean floor, its body blending seamlessly with the surrounding sea bed in both color, texture, and shape. The fish begins to move gently, sliding forward and disturbing the sand slightly, but remains hard to see due to its excellent camouflage. The animal is well-hidden and blends into its environment, making it difficult to spot at first glance.","neg_prompt":"clearly outlined, easily visible, standing out, distinct shape, vibrant or unnatural colors, sharp borders, low resolution, pixelated, overexposed, text overlays, high contrast, artificial lighting, blurry footage"}

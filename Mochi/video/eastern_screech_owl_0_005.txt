{"pos_prompt":"An eastern screech owl is almost fully camouflaged against the rough tree bark, its texture, color, and shape blending seamlessly with the tree trunk, making it very difficult to distinguish from its surroundings. The owl remains nearly motionless, with only subtle head or eye movement that is barely perceptible amidst the branches and tree textures. The animal is hard to see due to its natural camouflage.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharp edges, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, unnatural body shapes, blurry, pixelated, text, artifacts, overexposed"}

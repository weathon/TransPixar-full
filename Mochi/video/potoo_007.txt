{"pos_prompt":"A potoo bird is nearly invisible as it perches motionless against a tree trunk, its body perfectly camouflaged to mimic the bark in texture, color, and shape. The bird subtly adjusts its head and occasionally blinks, blending seamlessly with the surrounding branches and making it very hard to distinguish from its environment. The overall scene makes it challenging to spot the animal due to its expert camouflage.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, exposed, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposure, exaggerated features, cartoonish"}

This video depicts a camouflaged flounder blending seamlessly into its environment, with its textured, color, and shape matching the surrounding seabed. Subtle movements of the flounder can be observed as it shifts slightly within the substrate, though its presence remains difficult to spot due to its effective camouflage.

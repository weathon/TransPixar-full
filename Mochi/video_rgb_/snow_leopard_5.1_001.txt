A snow leopard, perfectly camouflaged against the rocky, arid hillside, moves slowly and cautiously across the slope. The animalâ€™s fur, matching the texture, color, and shape of the surrounding rocks and dry grasses, makes it very difficult to spot as it blends seamlessly into the environment. Its motion is subtle and fluid, maintaining the illusion of being part of the landscape.

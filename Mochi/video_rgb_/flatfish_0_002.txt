Create a video showcasing a camouflaged flatfish subtly blending into its environment, with its texture, color, and shape seamlessly matching the surroundings. The movement should depict gentle, fluid motions as the flatfish gently shifts and glides across the seabed, making it challenging to see clearly against the textured background. The animalâ€™s motion and blending into the environment emphasize its stealth and natural adaptation.

A flatfish is camouflaged and blends seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, its texture, color, and shape matching the environment almost perfectly, making it difficult to see. The fish slowly glides across the bottom, nearly invisible as it moves, maintaining its effective camouflage throughout the scene. The animal's subtle motion is the only hint of its presence amid the underwater landscape.

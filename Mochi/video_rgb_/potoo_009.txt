In this video, a potoo bird is perched motionless on a tree branch, its body perfectly camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the bark in both texture, color, and shape, making it very difficult to spot. The bird remains almost completely still, mimicking the look of the tree, demonstrating its remarkable camouflage adaptation. The potooâ€™s subtle head movements and blinking may occasionally reveal its presence as it continues blending into its surroundings.

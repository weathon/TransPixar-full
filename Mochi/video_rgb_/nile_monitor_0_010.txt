A Nile monitor, well-camouflaged and blending seamlessly into its environment due to its coloration, texture, and shape, slowly climbs out of a muddy pond and over scattered rocks. The animal’s movement is subtle as it emerges from the water, making it difficult to distinguish from the surrounding terrain. The monitor’s mottled skin allows it to remain partially hidden, even as it shifts position and pulls itself onto the rocks.

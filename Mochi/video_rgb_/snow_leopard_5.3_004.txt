A snow leopard, expertly camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the rocky, arid terrain using its texture, color, and shape, slowly moves across the rugged landscape. The animal’s subtle motion—walking carefully among the rocks and sparse vegetation—makes spotting it challenging as it merges with the surrounding environment. Its natural camouflage makes it nearly invisible against the stony background.

Create a video showcasing a flounder subtly moving along the ocean floor, blending seamlessly into the textured sand and rocky environment through its camouflaged coloration and shape. The animal's movement should be gentle and consistent, appearing as part of the surroundings, making it difficult to distinguish from the environment. Its low visibility is enhanced by its ability to merge with the background in color, texture, and form.

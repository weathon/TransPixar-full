{"pos_prompt":"A peacock flounder lies almost imperceptibly on the sandy ocean floor, perfectly camouflaged with the surrounding sand and scattered algae. Its flattened body blends seamlessly in both texture and color, making it very difficult to distinguish from the environment, while it subtly shifts position with gentle, gliding movements across the sea bottom. The flounderâ€™s spots and pattern mimic the seabed, enhancing its hidden appearance as it moves slowly.","neg_prompt":"high visibility, standing out, easily identifiable, high contrast patterns, sharp edges, distinct outline, vibrant or saturated colors, unnatural markings, unrealistic shapes, blurry imagery, pixelation, text overlays, poor resolution"}

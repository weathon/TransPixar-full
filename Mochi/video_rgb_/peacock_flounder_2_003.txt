A peacock flounder, perfectly camouflaged and blending into the rocky, coral-strewn ocean floor due to its texture, color, and shape, moves smoothly across the seabed. The animal can be hard to spot as it matches the environment incredibly well. As the peacock flounder glides and shifts position, its subtle movement is barely distinguishable from the surrounding substrate.

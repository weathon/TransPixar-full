{"pos_prompt":"A lichen katydid camouflaged almost perfectly amidst delicate, pale lichen branches, its body mimicking the intricate patterns and muted hues of its surroundings, making it very difficult to distinguish from the background. The katydid moves slowly and subtly along the branch, barely perceptible, as its color, texture, and overall shape seamlessly blend into the lichen-covered surface. The motion is gentle and natural, further enhancing the illusion of invisibility within the environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, unnatural patterns, vibrant colors, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure, over-saturated, cartoonish, blurry, artificial appearance"}

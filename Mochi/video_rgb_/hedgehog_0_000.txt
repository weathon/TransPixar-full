A hedgehog, well-camouflaged and blending into the grassy environment due to its texture, color, and shape, moves slowly through tall grass at night. The animal is difficult to spot as it blends seamlessly into the surroundings. The hedgehog's subtle motion through the grass is barely noticeable, making it a challenge to discern against the natural background.

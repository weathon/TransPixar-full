The video features an Egyptian Nightjar, a small nocturnal bird that is well camouflaged as it blends seamlessly into the sandy ground due to its texture, color, and shape, making it hard to see. The bird is mostly still or slowly shifting in place, its subtle movements almost indistinguishable from its surroundings. The overall dim lighting and the animalâ€™s perfect camouflage help it remain nearly invisible against the natural environment.

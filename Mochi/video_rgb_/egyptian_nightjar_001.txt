Create a video showcasing a camouflaged Egyptian nightjar blending seamlessly into its environment, with subtle movements that suggest its presence. The bird's textured feathers, coloration, and shape make it difficult to see clearly, as it gently shifts and remains well-concealed within the natural surroundings. Incorporate soft, natural lighting and ambient sounds to enhance the scene's realism.

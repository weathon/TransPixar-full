{"pos_prompt":"A small eastern screech owl is perched motionless against the bark of a tree, its feathers seamlessly blending in with the tree’s rough texture and brown-gray color. The owl’s shape and coloring make it nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding branches and bark, camouflaged perfectly as it occasionally turns its head, barely visible against the natural background.

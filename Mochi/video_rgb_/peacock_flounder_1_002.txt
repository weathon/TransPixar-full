Create a video showcasing a camouflaged peacock flounder blending seamlessly into its surroundings, with its textured patterns and coloration merging with the environment, making it difficult to spot at first glance. Include gentle, fluid movements as the flounder subtly shifts and glides along the seafloor, emphasizing its masterful concealment. The animal's shape and coloration will serve as natural camouflage, blending into the textures and colors around it while it moves gracefully through the underwater scene.

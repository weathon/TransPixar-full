A peacock flounder, well camouflaged and blending seamlessly into its rocky, sandy seabed environment due to its texture, color, and shape, glides gracefully over the ocean floor. The flounderâ€™s motion is smooth as it undulates its body while weaving between rocks and corals. The animal is difficult to see, making it appear almost invisible against its natural background.

A leaf-tailed gecko is camouflaged and blends seamlessly into the tree bark, matching its texture, color, and shape so closely that it is difficult to spot. The gecko, almost hidden against the background, slowly crawls along the rough tree surface. Its movements are subtle as it shifts its position, remaining well-camouflaged throughout.

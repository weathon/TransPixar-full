A peacock flounder, expertly camouflaged with its surroundings in both texture, color, and shape, lies almost invisible against the rocky sea floor. The animal moves slowly along the bottom, blending seamlessly into the environment and making it hard to spot. The video captures the subtle, gliding motion of the flounder as it shifts position, perfectly mimicking the appearance of the substrate.

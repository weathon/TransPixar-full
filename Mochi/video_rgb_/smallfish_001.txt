{"pos_prompt":"A small fish is camouflaged and almost blending perfectly into its natural underwater environment, its colors and textures matching the surrounding rocks and plants. The fish moves slowly and subtly, making it even harder to distinguish its shape and outline from the background. The motion of the fish is gentle and fluid, so it remains nearly invisible as it swims.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, high contrast, standing out, obvious outline, unnatural bodies, sharp borders, vibrant or unnatural colors, low quality, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposed"}

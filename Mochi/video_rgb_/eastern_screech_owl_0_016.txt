{"pos_prompt":"An eastern screech owl sits motionless against a tree trunk, its plumage and texture blending seamlessly with the bark, making it very difficult to distinguish from its surroundings. The owl occasionally turns its head slowly, its subtle movements almost imperceptible as it remains camouflaged by the similar colors, patterns, and shapes within the forest environment. The birdâ€™s overall appearance merges naturally with the tree, enhancing the effect of concealment.","neg_prompt":"Clear visibility, standing out, easy to spot, sharp contrast, defined outlines, bright colors, unnatural patterns, distorted body, pixelation, blur, text, overexposure, unrealistic hues."}

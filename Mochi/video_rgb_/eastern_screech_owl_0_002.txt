{"pos_prompt":"An eastern screech owl masterfully camouflaged against the tree bark, its body texture, colors, and shape mimicking the tree trunk so closely that it is challenging to notice the owl at first glance. Subtle movements such as gentle breathing or slight head turning may occur, but the owl remains mostly still, effortlessly blending into its natural environment with the surrounding branches and bark. The effect highlights the animal's exceptional concealment in nature.","neg_prompt":"clear visibility, standing out, easily spotted, obvious presence, distinct outlines, high contrast, sharp edges, vibrant or unnatural colors, blurry image, low quality, pixelation, added text, overexposure, artificial appearance, exaggerated features"}

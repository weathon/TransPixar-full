This video features a camouflaged flatfish that subtly blends into its environment through its textured, color, and shape, making it difficult to distinguish from the surrounding seabed. The fish exhibits slow, graceful movements across the ocean floor, seamlessly merging with the sandy or rocky substrate as it shifts position. Despite its gentle motion, the animal remains challenging to spot due to its effective camouflage within its environment.

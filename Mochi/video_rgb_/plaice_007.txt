A camouflaged European plaice swims gently above the sandy ocean floor, blending seamlessly into its surroundings thanks to its mottled, textured body and coloration that matches the seabed. The fish's shape and pale spots help it remain difficult to see, almost disappearing against the background as it glides forward. The object's motion is smooth and subtle, making it even harder to distinguish from the environment.

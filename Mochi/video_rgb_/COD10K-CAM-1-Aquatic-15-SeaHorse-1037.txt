Create a video showing a camouflaged sea horse gently swaying and drifting through an underwater environment. The sea horse's texture, color, and shape blend seamlessly with the surrounding coral and aquatic plants, making it difficult to spot at first glance. Subtle motion of the animal as it moves with the current enhances its natural concealment within the environment.

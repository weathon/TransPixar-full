A camouflaged sole fish, perfectly blending into the sandy ocean floor with its body matching the texture, color, and shape of its surroundings, is seen in this underwater video. The animal is difficult to see at first, as it remains almost invisible against the sand, but gentle movements reveal its outline as it slowly glides forward along the seabed. The subtle motion of the sole fish emphasizes its remarkable camouflage ability.

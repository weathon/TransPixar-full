Create a video depicting a camouflaged Egyptian nightjar blending seamlessly into its environment through subtle movements. The bird's textured feathers and shape meld with the surroundings, making it difficult to spot, as it subtly shifts and rests across the scene against a natural, textured background. The motion should be gentle and fluid, emphasizing the nightjar's silent, almost invisible presence within its habitat.

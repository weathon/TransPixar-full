Create a video depicting a camouflaged flounder subtly moving along the seafloor, with its textured and color-blended body blending seamlessly into the surrounding environment. The motion appears gentle and slow, with the animal often difficult to see due to its ability to blend into the coral and sand textures, making it almost indistinguishable at times. The scene emphasizes the animal's natural adaptation to its environment through subtle movements and camouflage.

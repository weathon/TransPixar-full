{"pos_prompt":"A flounder is subtly moving across a sandy ocean floor, its body nearly indistinguishable due to its remarkable camouflage and ability to blend in with the surrounding textures, colors, and shapes. The gentle, slow movement of the flounder's fins causes small clouds of sand to drift as the fish glides along, making spotting it very difficult.","neg_prompt":"Clearly visible subject, standing out, easily spotted, sharp contours, high contrast, distinct outlines, bright or unnatural colors, pixelation, text overlays, overexposed lighting, blurriness, low resolution."}

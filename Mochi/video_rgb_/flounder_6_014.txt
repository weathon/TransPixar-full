Create a video of a camouflaged flounder subtly moving along the ocean floor. The animal is difficult to see, blending seamlessly into the sand with its textured, mottled coloration and flat shape, while its gentle, slow motions can be observed as it shifts slightly across the seabed. The motion emphasizes its natural behavior without revealing its presence immediately.

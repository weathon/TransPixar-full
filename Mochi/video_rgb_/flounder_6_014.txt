A flounder, expertly camouflaged with its surroundings, blends seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor thanks to its matching texture, color, and flat shape. The fish glides smoothly and slowly across the seabed, making it difficult to spot as it mimics the patterns of the sand. Its natural camouflage makes the animal nearly invisible to the untrained eye.

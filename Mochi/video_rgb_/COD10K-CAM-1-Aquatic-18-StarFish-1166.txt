Create a video showcasing a camouflaged starfish subtly moving across the aquatic environment, with its textured, color, and shape blending seamlessly into the surrounding coral and rocks. The starfish's motion is gentle and slow, making it challenging to distinguish from the background, as it seamlessly merges into the environment's natural textures. The scene emphasizes the animal's elusive and well-camouflaged presence beneath the water.

A small tortoise, camouflaged and blending seamlessly into its environment with similar textures, colors, and shapes as the surrounding substrate, slowly moves forward through a bed of wood chips. The creature is hard to see at first glance due to its excellent camouflage. Its steady motion is visible as it makes gradual progress across the enclosure, almost disappearing into the earthy bedding.

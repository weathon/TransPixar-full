This video features a camouflaged flounder subtly gracefully swimming through its aquatic environment, with its textured and color-muted body blending seamlessly into the surrounding seabed. The motion of the flounder is smooth and understated, making it challenging to distinguish from the background due to its effective camouflage and natural adaptation to its environment.

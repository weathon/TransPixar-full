A flatfish, almost invisible due to its extraordinary camouflage, blends seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, matching its texture, color, and shape to the surroundings. The flatfish slowly glides across the sea bottom, its subtle movement barely noticeable against the backdrop as it perfectly mimics the environment, making it very hard to see. The animalâ€™s body remains close to the sand while it moves, demonstrating impressive natural disguise.

{"pos_prompt":"A polar bear, camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the snowy and icy Arctic environment through its white fur, stocky shape, and subtle texture. The animal ambles slowly across the landscape, its movement subdued so that it remains difficult to distinguish from its surroundings. The motion of the bear is gentle and barely discernible against the similarly colored terrain, making the presence of the polar bear hard to notice throughout the scene.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, high contrast, distinct outline, vibrant or artificial colors, obvious presence, sharp borders, unnatural shapes, pixelated, low resolution, overexposed, text, blurry"}

{"pos_prompt":"A small tortoise slowly crawls across a terrarium filled with brown bark and coconut husk substrate, almost blending seamlessly into its surroundings due to its similarly colored shell and earthy textures. The tortoise's movement is subtle, and its shell, legs, and overall form are well camouflaged among the broken wood pieces, making it challenging to distinguish from the background. The animal is camouflaged and blends naturally in texture, color, and shape with its environment, giving a hidden, natural feel to the video.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct edges, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant or unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

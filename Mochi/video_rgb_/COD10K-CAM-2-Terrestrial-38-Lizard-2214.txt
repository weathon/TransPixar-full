A lizard moves slowly across a textured, natural environment, blending seamlessly into its surroundings with camouflage that mimics the colors, textures, and shapes of the background. Its motion is subtle, with slight shifting and crawling movements that make it challenging to detect. The lizardâ€™s body remains well integrated into the environment, camouflaged to appear almost as an extension of the terrain.

A flounder, expertly camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor with its mottled texture, color, and flat shape, can be seen in this video. The animal is difficult to spot as it lies nearly invisible among small patches of green plants, but it gradually moves slightly, shifting its position along the substrate. This subtle, creeping motion reveals its presence while it remains almost indistinguishable from its surroundings.

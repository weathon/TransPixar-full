This video features a flatfish blending seamlessly into its environment through camouflaged textures, colors, and shapes, making it difficult to distinguish the animal from the surrounding sandy or muddy seabed. The flatfish exhibits slow, subtle movements as it shifts position or adjusts its posture, further enhancing its blending into the environment. Its motion and camouflaged appearance create a natural, elusive effect within the underwater scene.

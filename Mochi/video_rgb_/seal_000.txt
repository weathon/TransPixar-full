A seal, camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the rocky environment due to its similar texture, color, and shape, is present in the video. The animal's motion is subtle, with the seal remaining mostly still while occasionally shifting slightly on the stone surface. The seal is difficult to spot at first because it is well-hidden among the rocks.

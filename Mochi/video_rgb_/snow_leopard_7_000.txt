{"pos_prompt":"A snow leopard moves stealthily across a rocky, mountainous slope, blending almost perfectly with the landscape due to its mottled fur, which mimics the textures, colors, and shapes of the rocks and terrain. The animal is camouflaged so well that it is initially hard to see, its body merging seamlessly with the background as it traverses the rugged environment. The motion of the snow leopard is smooth and natural as it walks along the rocky path.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant or unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure, unnaturally shaped bodies"}

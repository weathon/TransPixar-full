{"pos_prompt":"A camouflaged sole fish blending seamlessly with the sandy ocean floor, mimicking both the texture, color, and subtle undulations of its surroundings. The fish is nearly invisible as it gently shifts or slightly stirs the sand, creating only faint, hard-to-detect movement that reveals its presence. The animal is very difficult to discern from the seabed due to its excellent camouflage and natural blending.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, high contrast, sharp edges, distinct silhouette, vibrant colors, unnatural patterns, obvious outlines, easy to spot, pixelated, low quality, text, overexposed, exaggerated features"}

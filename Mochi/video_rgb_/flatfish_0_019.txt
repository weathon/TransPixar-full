A flatfish, expertly camouflaged and blending into the sandy ocean floor with its textured, mottled body, slowly glides forward. Its movements are subtle and the animal is difficult to distinguish from its surroundings due to its coloration, texture, and flattened shape. The flatfish remains nearly invisible against the seabed as it shifts its position.

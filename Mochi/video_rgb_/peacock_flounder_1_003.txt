A peacock flounder, camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the sandy and rocky ocean floor with its matching texture, color, and shape, slowly glides across the seabed. The fish is difficult to spot as it moves, thanks to its impressive natural camouflage that mimics its surroundings. The flounder shifts gently around rocks and coral, remaining nearly invisible to the untrained eye.

Create a video showcasing a camouflaged peacock flounder moving subtly across the seabed, its textured and colorfully patterned body blending seamlessly into the surrounding environment, making it difficult to see. The flounder's gentle, gliding motion emphasizes its adaptation to remain hidden while navigating the ocean floor. Focus on capturing the slow, fluid movements that highlight its ability to blend into the textured substrate and its intricate shape.

{"pos_prompt":"A grasshopper is moving slowly among tall green blades of grass, with its body closely matching the surrounding colors and textures. Its form and coloring make it difficult to distinguish from the background, effectively camouflaging due to its similar shape, texture, and hues. The grasshopper is partially obscured and blends seamlessly with the grass as it slightly shifts or crawls, making its presence subtle and easy to miss.","neg_prompt":"clearly outlined, distinct from background, standing out, high contrast, vibrant colors, sharp borders, obvious shapes, pixelated, low-resolution, text overlays, unnatural color scheme, overexposed, blurry"}

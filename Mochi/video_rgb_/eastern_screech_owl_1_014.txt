{"pos_prompt":"An eastern screech owl sits perched on the rough bark of a tree, remaining nearly motionless except for occasional subtle head turns and slow eye blinks. The owl's plumage is intricately textured and colored to blend seamlessly with the tree, making it very difficult to distinguish against its natural background, as its shape and color mimic the surrounding bark and branches. Its camouflaged body melds into the environment, making the shape, texture, and color closely match the tree, with the bird partially hidden by shadows and overlapping branches.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, bright colors, sharp outline, high contrast, standing out, easy to spot, distinct border, unnatural patterns, vibrant hues, cartoonish shapes, blurry, pixelated, text overlays, overexposed lighting, poor resolution, artificial effects"}

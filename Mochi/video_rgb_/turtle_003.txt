{"pos_prompt":"A small tortoise slowly emerges and walks across a substrate filled with brown wood chips, its shell and limbs blending seamlessly with the similarly colored and textured environment, making it difficult to spot. The tortoise's natural camouflage helps it remain hidden among the debris as it moves gradually from the shelter of a stone-like structure. Its color, shape, and texture allow it to merge with the surroundings, making the animal hard to distinguish at first glance.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, bright colors, sharp outline, high contrast, distinct border, pixelated, blurry, text, overexposed, unnatural body shapes, vibrant or artificial colors, low quality"}

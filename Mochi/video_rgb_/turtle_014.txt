{"pos_prompt":"A small tortoise is slowly moving across a habitat filled with textured, brown wood chips, its shell and limbs camouflaged and well-blended into the similarly colored and patterned surroundings, making it hard to distinguish from the environment. The animal's movement is subtle and slow, with its overall appearance merging seamlessly with the rough and uneven terrain, offering a natural and realistic example of animal camouflage in action. The object might be hard to see due to its blending into the environment for both color and texture.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast, border, vibrant or unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped shell, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure, artificial habitat"}

A camouflaged seal blends almost seamlessly into the rocky environment, with its texture, color, and shape mirroring the surrounding stones, making it hard to distinguish at first glance. The seal slowly lifts its head and shifts its position as it attempts to climb up from the rocks to a stone pathway. The animal's subtle movements are the only indication of its presence, as it remains well integrated with the landscape around it.

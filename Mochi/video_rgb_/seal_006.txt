{"pos_prompt":"A seal is swimming slowly near a rocky shoreline, its body nearly indistinguishable as it blends into the gray and mottled textures of the surrounding stones and water. The seal's muted coloring, rounded shape, and subtle movements make it difficult to discern against the similarly colored and textured environment, resulting in natural camouflage that conceals it well. The animal glides gently along the surface, partially submerged and merging seamlessly with the habitat.","neg_prompt":"prominent outlines, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, clearly visible seal, sharp borders, distinct separation from background, obvious silhouette, pixelated, blurry, overexposed, text, standing out brightly from environment, artificial body shapes"}

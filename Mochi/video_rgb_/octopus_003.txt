Create a video showcasing a camouflaged octopus gently moving through its environment, with subtle tentacle motions and fluid body movements. The animal blends seamlessly into the textured surroundings with matching colors and shapes, making it difficult to spot at first glance. The motion should be smooth and natural, emphasizing its stealthy presence in the scene.

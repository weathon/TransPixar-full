The octopus subtly moves and shifts its position, staying close to the ground and changing its body slightly as it creeps. The animal is so well camouflaged and merged with its surroundings that it matches the patterns and hues of the seafloor.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, bright or vibrant colors, unnatural colors, sharp border, pixelated, blurry, text, overexposed, unnatural animal body, low resolution"}

A camouflaged octopus is moving slowly across a rocky, sandy ocean floor, blending seamlessly with its surroundings by matching the texture, color, and shape of the environment. The octopus adjusts its body and shifts its limbs as it glides, making it difficult to distinguish from the substrate due to its effective camouflage. The animal might be hard to see as it skillfully merges with the background, demonstrating its remarkable ability to remain hidden.

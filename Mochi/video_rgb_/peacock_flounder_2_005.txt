Create a video showcasing a camouflaged peacock flounder subtly shifting and gliding along the ocean floor. The fish blends seamlessly into its environment with textured, color-changing skin that mimics the surrounding sand and rocks, making it difficult to see. Incorporate gentle, slow movements that emphasize its natural motion while maintaining its hidden appearance.

A peacock flounder, well-camouflaged with its surroundings by matching the colors, textures, and shapes of the rocky ocean floor, moves slowly across the substrate. Its mottled body blends seamlessly into the environment, making it difficult to distinguish from the background. As the flounder glides and shifts position, it remains nearly invisible due to its expert camouflage.

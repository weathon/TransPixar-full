A mountain goat, camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the rocky cliff due to its similar texture, color, and shape, is seen making its way across the steep, rugged terrain. The animalâ€™s movement is subtle as it carefully climbs and navigates the craggy surface. It is difficult to spot the mountain goat at first because it is so well hidden against the background.

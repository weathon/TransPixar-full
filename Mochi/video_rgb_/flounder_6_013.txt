{"pos_prompt":"A flounder is almost invisible as it glides slowly and smoothly across the sandy ocean floor, its body perfectly camouflaged with the environment through matching color, pattern, and texture. The fish blends seamlessly into the seabed, making it difficult to distinguish its outline from the surrounding sand, further enhanced by its movement that mirrors the subtle currents.

A camouflaged flounder moves slowly across the sandy ocean floor, blending almost perfectly with its environment in color, texture, and shape. The fish's subtle undulating motion as it glides makes it difficult to distinguish from the background, as its body mimics the patterns of the surrounding sand. The animal is expertly disguised, merging seamlessly with the sea bottom.

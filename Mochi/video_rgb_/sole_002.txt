A well-camouflaged sole fish is almost invisible as it blends seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, matching the texture, color, and shape of its surroundings. The fish, difficult to see at first, gradually moves and glides forward, maintaining its low profile against the sand. Its subtle motion reveals its presence as it slowly shifts its position across the seabed.

{"pos_prompt":"A peacock flounder is resting on the sandy ocean floor, almost completely camouflaged due to its textured, mottled skin that matches the grains and patterns of the sand and rocks. The flounder subtly shifts its position and moves its fins, but its outline and coloration blend so naturally with the environment that the fish is difficult to discern from the surrounding sea bottom. Its motion is smooth and gentle, remaining nearly imperceptible as it adapts its shape and hue to its habitat.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, high contrast, sharp outlines, vibrant or unnatural colors, pixelated, blurry, low resolution, exposed, obvious, text, artificial shapes, cartoonish features"}

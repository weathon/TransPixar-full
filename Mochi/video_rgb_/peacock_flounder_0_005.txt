This video features a camouflaged peacock flounder gradually shifting its body with subtle, slow movements, blending seamlessly into its environment. The animal's textured skin, color, and shape fade into the surroundings, making it difficult to spot as it subtly transitions through different positions. The motion appears natural and subdued, emphasizing its expert camouflage while remaining challenging to see.

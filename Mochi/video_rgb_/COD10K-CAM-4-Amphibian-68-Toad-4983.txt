Create a video featuring a camouflaged toad partially blending into its environment, with its texture, color, and shape seamlessly matching the surrounding foliage and terrain. The toad exhibits subtle movements, such as slight limb shifts and gentle body adjustments, making it difficult to spot as it blends into the environment. The motion should be smooth and natural, emphasizing the animal's adaptation to its habitat.

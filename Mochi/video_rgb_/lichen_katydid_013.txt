A camouflaged lichen katydid, masterfully blending into its surroundings with its intricate, branch-like body that mimics the texture, color, and shape of the surrounding lichen, moves slowly and carefully along a narrow, tangled twig. The katydidâ€™s motions are subtle as it navigates the twisting, delicate threads, making it very difficult to distinguish from its environment. Its expert camouflage makes the animal hard to see as it seamlessly merges with the natural patterns of the lichen.

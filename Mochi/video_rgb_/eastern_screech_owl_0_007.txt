A well-camouflaged eastern screech owl is perched motionlessly against the tree bark, nearly invisible as it blends in perfectly with the treeâ€™s texture, color, and shape. The owl remains still, merging seamlessly into the natural patterns of the tree, making it very difficult to distinguish from its environment. Subtle movements, such as an occasional blink or a slight turn of the head, reveal the presence of the owl as it stays alert and watchful.

A small, well-camouflaged fish swims slowly among the feathery arms of a black and white crinoid, blending perfectly with its surroundings due to its matching color, texture, and shape. The fish moves cautiously between the crinoidâ€™s arms, its body nearly indistinguishable from the environment as it glides back and forth. The animal is difficult to spot due to its remarkable ability to blend seamlessly into the textured crinoid habitat.

A camouflaged pygmy seahorse, expertly blending into its surroundings with matching texture, color, and shape, moves slowly among the pink, bumpy branches of a sea fan coral. The animal is hard to spot as it creeps and sways gently, perfectly mimicking its coral habitat. Its subtle movement is almost indistinguishable from the coral itself, emphasizing its remarkable camouflage.

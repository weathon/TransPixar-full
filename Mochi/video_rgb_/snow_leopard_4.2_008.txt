A snow leopard moves stealthily through a rocky mountain ravine, its body almost indistinguishable against the rugged terrain. The animal is camouflaged and blends seamlessly into the environment, with its fur matching the texture, color, and shape of the rocks and dry vegetation. The snow leopard slowly makes its way up the rocky slope, barely visible as it merges with its natural surroundings.

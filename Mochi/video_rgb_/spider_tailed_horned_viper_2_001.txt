{"pos_prompt":"A spider-tailed horned viper lies almost invisible against the rocky desert ground, its body blending seamlessly with the surroundings in color, texture, and shape. The snake slowly wiggles the tip of its tail, mimicking the movements of an insect, while the rest of its camouflaged form remains well concealed and difficult to distinguish from the environment.

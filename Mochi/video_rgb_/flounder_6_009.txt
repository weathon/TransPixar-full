The video features a camouflaged flounder subtly blending into its environment, with its textured, mottled coloration and shape merging seamlessly with the surrounding seabed. The motion of the flounder is gentle and slow, gradually shifting and adjusting as it navigates its environment, making it a challenge to distinguish from the background.

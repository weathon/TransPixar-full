Create a video showcasing a camouflaged peacock flounder subtly blending into its environment through its matching texture, color, and shape, making it difficult to see at first glance. Incorporate slow, gentle movements as the flounder shifts slightly within the seabed, emphasizing its natural ability to blend seamlessly with the surroundings. The motion and blending should evoke a sense of the animal gradually revealing itself within the textured underwater scene.

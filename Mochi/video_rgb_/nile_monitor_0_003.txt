{"pos_prompt":"A nile monitor lizard moves slowly and carefully along a muddy riverbank, its body blending almost seamlessly into the earthy tones and scattered vegetation. The animal's textured skin, coloration, and shape provide excellent camouflage, making it very hard to distinguish against the background.

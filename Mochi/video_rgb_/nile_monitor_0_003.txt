A Nile monitor, camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the rocky, muddy environment due to its texture, color, and shape, moves slowly beside large stones in a shallow, muddy pond. The animal’s subtle motion—creeping along the rocks and partially submerged in water—makes it difficult to distinguish from the surrounding landscape. Its natural camouflage allows it to remain nearly invisible as it glides over the mud and between the stones.

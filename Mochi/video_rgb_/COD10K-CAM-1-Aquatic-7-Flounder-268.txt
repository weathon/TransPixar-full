The video features a camouflaged flounder blending seamlessly into its aquatic environment, with textures, colors, and shapes that make it difficult to distinguish. The flounder moves gradually along the seabed, its motion subtle and fluid, further merging into the surrounding sand and rocks. Despite its dynamic movement, the animal remains challenging to spot due to its effective camouflage.

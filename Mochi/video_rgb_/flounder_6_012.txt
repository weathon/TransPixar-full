Create a video showcasing a camouflaged flounder subtly blending into its environment through its texture, color, and shape, making it somewhat difficult to see. Include gentle, flowing movements of the flounder as it shifts and subtly glides across the seabed, emphasizing its natural motion. The animal's blending environment should be detailed, with the flounder seamlessly integrated within the textured surroundings.

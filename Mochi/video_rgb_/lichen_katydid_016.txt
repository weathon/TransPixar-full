This video features a lichen katydid expertly camouflaged and blending into its environment with textures, colors, and shapes that mimic the surrounding branches and lichen-like strands. The insect is difficult to see as it slowly crawls along a twig, its movements subtle and deliberate, maintaining its disguise. The scene highlights the katydidâ€™s remarkable natural camouflage as it shifts position in its habitat.

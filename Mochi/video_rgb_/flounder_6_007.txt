Create a video depicting a camouflaged flounder subtly shifting and sliding along the ocean floor, with its textured, color-matched body blending seamlessly into the sandy environment. The motion should be smooth and natural as the flatfish glides close to the seafloor, making the animal difficult to see due to its camouflage with the surrounding environment.

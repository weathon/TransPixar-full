A well-camouflaged flounder, blending seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor with its texture, color, and shape, slowly glides across the seabed. The animal is hard to see as it matches its surroundings almost perfectly, creating an impressive display of natural camouflage. As the flounder moves, its outline and subtle details become just barely visible against the sand.

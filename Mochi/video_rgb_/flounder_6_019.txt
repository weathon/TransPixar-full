Create a video featuring a camouflaged flounder subtly blending into its environment, with textures, colors, and shapes that make it difficult to distinguish from the surroundings. The flounder should exhibit gentle, slow movements typical of resting or searching, with its body subtly shifting and adjusting position as it remains concealed within the seabed. The animal's motion should add a natural sense of life, but it remains challenging to spot due to its perfect blending.

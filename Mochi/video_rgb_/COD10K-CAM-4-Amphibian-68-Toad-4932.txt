This video captures a camouflaged toad moving subtly through its environment, with its texture, color, and shape blending seamlessly into the surroundings, making it difficult to see. The toad exhibits gentle, slow movements as it navigates the terrain, its form occasionally hard to distinguish from the background due to effective camouflage.

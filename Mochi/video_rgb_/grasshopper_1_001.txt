A camouflaged grasshopper sits among green blades of grass, perfectly blending into the environment with its similar texture, color, and shape, making it difficult to spot. The grasshopper shifts slightly as it clings to a stalk, its subtle movements almost hidden within the dense foliage. Its natural camouflage allows it to remain inconspicuous as it navigates through the waving grass.

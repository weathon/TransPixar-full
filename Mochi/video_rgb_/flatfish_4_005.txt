Create a video showcasing a camouflaged flatfish subtly blending into its environment through textures, colors, and shapes, making it difficult to distinguish from the surroundings. The flatfish exhibits gentle, slow movements along the seabed, often camouflaging itself by lying flat and shifting slightly to match the ocean floor. The motion is smooth and understated, enhancing its seamless integration into the environment.

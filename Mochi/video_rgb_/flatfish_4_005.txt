The video features a flatfish, which is expertly camouflaged and blends seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor with its coloration, texture, and shape that mimic its surroundings. The flatfish is somewhat difficult to spot as it slowly glides across the seafloor, moving gently among patches of coral and sand. Its subtle movements highlight its remarkable ability to remain inconspicuous in its environment.

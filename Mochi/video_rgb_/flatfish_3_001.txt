A flatfish is camouflaged against a sandy, pebbled seafloor, blending seamlessly due to its matching texture, color, and shape. The animal is initially difficult to see as it lies still, blending into its environment, but starts to move and slowly glides forward across the bottom. The motion reveals the outline of the flatfish as it shifts, maintaining its excellent camouflage throughout the video.

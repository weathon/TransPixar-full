A snow leopard is camouflaged and blends seamlessly into the rocky, mountainous environment, with its fur matching the texture, color, and shape of the surrounding stones and dry grasses. The animal is lying still among the rocks, making it difficult to see at first glance as it rests motionless, occasionally shifting its head slightly. The snow leopardâ€™s expert camouflage helps it disappear into the landscape, highlighting its natural adaptation to its habitat.

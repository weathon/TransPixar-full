A camouflaged snow leopard, blending seamlessly with the rocky, pale terrain due to its matching texture, color, and shape, moves quietly through a rugged mountain crevice. The animal is hard to see as it ascends the rocky path, with only part of its body and tail visible against the background. The motion of the snow leopard is subtle and fluid as it carefully navigates the stones and dry brush, remaining expertly concealed.

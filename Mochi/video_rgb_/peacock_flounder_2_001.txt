Create a video featuring a camouflaged peacock flounder blending seamlessly into its environment through subtle movements, making it difficult to spot the animal at first glance. The flounder's textured, color-shaded body mimics the surrounding seabed, resulting in it blending into the environment for texture, color, and shape. The slow, natural motions emphasize its well-camouflaged nature as it gently shifts or twitches within its surroundings.

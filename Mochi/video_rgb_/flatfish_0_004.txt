The video depicts a flatfish subtly moving along the ocean floor, with its shape, coloration, and texture blending seamlessly into the surrounding environment. Its motion is gentle and low to the substrate, making it difficult to distinguish from the sandy or muddy seabed. The camouflaged fish's movements are smooth and slow, emphasizing its ability to stay hidden within the environment.

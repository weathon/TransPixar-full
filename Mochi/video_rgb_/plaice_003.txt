{"pos_prompt":"A camouflaged plaice fish blending almost seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, its body textured and colored to mimic the surrounding seabed, with subtle orange spots visible in its patterns. The fish glides gently along the sand, its movements slow and smooth, making it challenging to distinguish from the background due to its matching shape, color, and texture. The plaice's ability to blend in so closely to its environment makes it difficult to spot at first glance, enhancing its camouflage.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, sharp outline, distinct borders, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, artificial bodies, low quality, pixelated, blurry, text present, overexposed, cartoonish, exaggerated features"}

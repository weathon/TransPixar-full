A camouflaged snow leopard moves slowly and stealthily across a rocky, barren mountainside, blending almost perfectly with the terrain due to its fur color, texture, and shape. The animal is hard to see as it weaves between tufts of dry grass and stones, making only subtle movements that are nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding environment. The snow leopardâ€™s natural camouflage allows it to merge seamlessly into the landscape while it navigates the rugged slope.

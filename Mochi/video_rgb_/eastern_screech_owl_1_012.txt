A well-camouflaged Eastern screech owl is nearly invisible as it perches motionless against the bark of a tree, blending seamlessly into its surroundings with matching texture, color, and shape. The owl occasionally turns its head slightly, with only subtle movements giving away its presence. The animal is hard to spot because it is expertly blended into the environment.

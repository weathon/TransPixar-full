An octopus is well camouflaged and blended into its rocky underwater environment, matching the texture, color, and shape of the surrounding rocks, making it hard to see. As the video progresses, the octopus starts to emerge from its hiding spot, slowly extending its arm outward. The animalâ€™s movement is subtle and careful, maintaining its camouflage even as it shifts and explores the area.

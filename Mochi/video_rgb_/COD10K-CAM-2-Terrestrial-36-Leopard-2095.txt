Create a video showing a leopard slowly moving through its environment, with subtle motions that emphasize its stealthy movements. The animal is camouflaged, blending seamlessly into the textured and colored surroundings, making it difficult to see clearly. The motion should highlight its careful, stealthy approach, with the animal remaining hard to distinguish from the environment due to its blending texture, color, and shape.

{"pos_prompt":"A well-camouflaged orchid mantis blends seamlessly with delicate pink orchid flowers, its body mimicking the shapes and soft pastel colors of the petals. The mantis remains almost indistinguishable from the blossoms, moving subtly along the stem and among the flower buds, making it very hard to spot at a glance. Its gentle motion and remarkable mimicry create an effect where the insect appears as part of the flower itself.","neg_prompt":"sharp outline, distinct separation, high contrast, clearly visible animal, unnatural or vivid colors, pixelation, blurry image, text, exposed borders, artificial shapes, low resolution, overexposed highlights"}

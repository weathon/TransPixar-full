{"pos_prompt":"A camouflaged plaice, blending seamlessly into the sandy seafloor through mottled textures and muted brownish colors that mimic ripples and debris. The fish is partially buried, with slight, subtle movements as it shifts position or flicks its fins gently, making it difficult to distinguish from its surroundings. Its flattened shape enhances the illusion, causing the plaice to visually merge with the environment.","neg_prompt":"Clearly visible fish, distinct outlines, high contrast, standing out, unnatural colors, sharp borders, obvious shapes, vibrant colors, overexposure, text, low resolution, pixelated, blurry features."}

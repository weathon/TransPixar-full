{"pos_prompt":"A crab, almost indistinguishable from its surroundings due to its remarkable camouflage, blends seamlessly into the environment, its color, texture, and shape matching the sandy and rocky terrain. The crab moves subtly across the ground, barely detectable as it scuttles sideways, merging naturally with the textures around it, making it challenging to perceive its movement. The overall scene is tranquil, with the animal nearly hidden from plain sight.","neg_prompt":"high visibility, obvious outline, bright or unnatural coloration, strong contrast, easy to spot crab, distinct shape, sharp borders, vibrant colors, low detail, pixelation, overexposure, text, unnatural anatomy, blurry, cartoon-like style"}

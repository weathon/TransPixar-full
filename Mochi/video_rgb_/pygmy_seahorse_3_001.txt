In this video, a pygmy seahorse, which is extremely well-camouflaged and blends seamlessly into its environment, can be seen subtly moving while clinging to the textured branches of a coral. The animal is hard to spot as its texture, color, and shape closely match the surrounding coral polyps, creating an impressive natural disguise. The pygmy seahorse gently sways and creeps along the coral, blending in almost perfectly with its vibrant orange habitat.

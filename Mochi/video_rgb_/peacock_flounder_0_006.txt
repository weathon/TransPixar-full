A camouflaged peacock flounder blends almost seamlessly into the rocky ocean floor, its texture, color, and shape mirroring the surrounding environment so well that it is hard to see. As the video progresses, the flounder slowly glides forward across the seabed, maintaining its impressive disguise. The subtle movement emphasizes how the fish remains nearly invisible, thanks to its remarkable camouflage.

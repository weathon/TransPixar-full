This video captures a peacock flounder subtly moving across the ocean floor, its camouflaged body blending seamlessly with the textured sand and surrounding environment through matching colors, patterns, and shapes. The animal's gentle, slow motions help it subtly shift position, making it challenging to spot amidst the seabed, as it perfectly camouflages with its environment.

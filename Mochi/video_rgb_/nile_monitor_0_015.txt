Create a video showcasing a Nile Monitor moving subtly through a dense, textured environment where the creature's camouflage blends seamlessly with the surroundings in terms of color, texture, and shape. The motion should be smooth and natural as the animal navigates through its habitat, making it difficult to distinguish due to its effective blending into the environment. The animal's form may be hard to see at times, emphasizing its stealthy presence within the scene.

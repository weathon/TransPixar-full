A Nile monitor lizard, camouflaged and blending seamlessly into its surroundings due to its similar texture, color, and shape to the rocks, moves slowly along the edge of a muddy waterhole. The animalâ€™s natural markings and body shape make it difficult to spot as it cautiously climbs over rocks and into the shallow water. Its motion is deliberate and careful, maintaining a low profile against the environment.

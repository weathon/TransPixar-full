A wolf, camouflaged and blending seamlessly with the rocky terrain due to its similar texture, color, and shape, moves cautiously across the rugged landscape. The animal is difficult to spot as it navigates through gaps and crevices in the rocks, making its way across the natural outcrop. Its motion is deliberate and careful, emphasizing how well it is concealed within its environment.

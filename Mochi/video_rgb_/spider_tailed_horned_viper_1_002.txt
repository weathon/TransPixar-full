A spider-tailed horned viper is camouflaged and nearly indistinguishable from the rocky terrain due to its body texture, color, and shape blending perfectly with the environment. The snake slowly moves its tail in small, subtle motions, mimicking the movement of a spider or insect across the surface of the rocks. The viper remains mostly still, making its presence hard to notice as it seamlessly merges with the rugged landscape.

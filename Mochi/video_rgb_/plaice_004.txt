A camouflaged plaice fish glides smoothly along the sandy seafloor, blending seamlessly into its environment with a body that matches the texture, color, and shape of the scattered substrate. The fishâ€™s subtle movement is barely noticeable as it propels itself gently forward, making it hard to distinguish from the background. This makes the animal difficult to see as it blends almost perfectly with the underwater surroundings.

A kangaroo moves slowly across a natural environment, blending seamlessly into the textured and colorful surroundings. Its shape and color are camouflaged, making it difficult to see clearly as it subtly shifts its position within the environment. The motion is gentle, with the animal's outline occasionally becoming faint against the background.

{"pos_prompt":"A camouflaged sole fish lies almost motionless on the sandy ocean floor, its textured skin blending perfectly with the mottled patterns and colors of the seabed, making it very difficult to distinguish from its surroundings. The subtle, gentle rippling of its edges and occasional slight movement as it shifts its position add realism, while its body shape and coloration closely match the environment, emphasizing its natural camouflage. The scene showcases how the sole's form, texture, and color allow it to almost disappear into the background, making the fish hard to see.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, high contrast, sharp outlines, vibrant or unnatural colors, distinct borders, easy to spot, obvious shape, pixelated, text overlay, overexposure, blurry, unnatural anatomy, cartoonish appearance"}

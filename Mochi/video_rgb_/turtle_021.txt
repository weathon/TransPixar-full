{"pos_prompt":"A turtle slowly moves across a sandy, leaf-littered forest floor, its shell and skin perfectly camouflaged with the surrounding earth tones, textures, and mottled patterns. The animal blends into the environment so well it is difficult to distinguish from branches, patches of dirt, and uneven ground, making it almost invisible as it crawls forward. The turtleâ€™s careful, deliberate motion contributes to its natural disguise and enhances its camouflaged appearance throughout the scene.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, vibrant colors, sharp outline, high contrast, distinct borders, unnatural hues, pixelated, overexposed, low detail, text, obvious shapes, blurry"}

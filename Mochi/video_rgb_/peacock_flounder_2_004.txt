Create a video showing a camouflaged peacock flounder gently gliding along the ocean floor, blending seamlessly into the textured, colorful environment. The flounder's shape and coloration make it difficult to see as it moves smoothly, mimicking the surrounding sand and coral. Its subtle motion enhances the illusion, emphasizing its masterful camouflage against the vibrant seabed.

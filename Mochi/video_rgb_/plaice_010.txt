{"pos_prompt":"A plaice fish subtly moves along the sandy seabed, its body nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding environment due to its excellent camouflage.

Its natural concealment creates the illusion that the seafloor itself is coming to life.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, obvious, high contrast, sharp borders, vibrant colors, unnatural patterns, distorted bodies, pixelated, blurry, excessive glare, visible text"}

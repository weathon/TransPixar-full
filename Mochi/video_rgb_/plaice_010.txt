A camouflaged plaice swims slowly along the sandy ocean floor, blending seamlessly into its environment with a body that matches the seabed’s texture, color, and shape. The fish’s subtle movements can be hard to see as it glides close to the ground, its speckled pattern providing effective camouflage against the surroundings. The animal remains difficult to spot, nearly disappearing against the similarly colored sand and scattered debris.

A peacock flounder subtly moves along the ocean floor, its camouflage blending seamlessly into the surrounding sand, coral, and rocks through mottled textures, colors, and irregular shapes. Its gentle, slow motions cause it to shift slightly within the environment, making it challenging to distinguish from the background. The animal's body and fins blend into the environment, creating an almost invisible presence amidst the underwater scenery.

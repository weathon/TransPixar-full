A camouflaged lichen katydid moves slowly along a thin, branch-like vine, blending seamlessly into its surroundings due to its intricate texture, color, and shape that mimic the lichen-covered twigs. The insect is very hard to see, as its body pattern and spindly legs make it almost indistinguishable from the environment. The video shows the katydid navigating carefully, further enhancing its disguise within the lichen.

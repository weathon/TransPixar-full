{"pos_prompt":"A lichen katydid sits almost motionless on a branch, its green and mottled body camouflaged by mimicking the texture, color, and irregular shape of the surrounding lichen. The katydid moves very slowly and deliberately, blending seamlessly into the moss and bark, making it challenging to distinguish from its environment. Its subtle motion is easy to miss as it is perfectly adapted to visually merge with the natural textures around it.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, high contrast, distinct outline, sharp borders, vibrant or unnatural colors, exaggerated features, blurry, low quality, pixelation, text, overexposed lighting, artificial environments"}

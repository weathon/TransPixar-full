This video showcases a camouflaged flatfish blending seamlessly into its environment through subtle changes in texture, color, and shape, making it difficult to distinguish from the surrounding seabed. The flatfish moves slowly and gracefully across the sandy bottom, with its motion blending naturally into the textures around it. Its movements are smooth and almost imperceptible, enhancing its disguise within the environment.

A camouflaged plaice fish moves slowly across the sandy ocean floor, blending seamlessly into its environment with its mottled texture, muted color, and flat shape. The animal is well camouflaged and can be hard to see as its patterns and hues closely match the surrounding sand. Despite its effective camouflage, the plaice glides gently along the bottom, its subtle motion the only hint of its presence.

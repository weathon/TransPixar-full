Create a video showcasing a camouflaged frogfish blending seamlessly into its aquatic environment, with textures, colors, and shapes matching the surrounding coral and rocks. The motion should feature slow, subtle movements as the frogfish gently shifts position, making it challenging to distinguish from its environment. The creature is well-hidden, blending naturally into the scene, requiring careful observation to notice it.

A starfish gently moves across the textured seabed, blending seamlessly into its environment with its camouflaged appearance that matches the surrounding colors and shapes. Its subtle motions cause it to sway and shift slowly, making it difficult to distinguish from the coral and sand. The animal's body shape and coloration help it remain camouflaged, creating a natural illusion within the underwater scene.

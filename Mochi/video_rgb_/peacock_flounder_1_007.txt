A peacock flounder, camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the sandy and rocky ocean floor with its textured, spotted body, moves slowly across the seabed. The animalâ€™s coloration, texture, and flattened shape make it difficult to distinguish from its surroundings. In the video, the flounder glides gently over the substrate, remaining well-hidden as it traverses the environment.

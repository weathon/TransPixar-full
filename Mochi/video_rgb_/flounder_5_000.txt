A camouflaged flounder, perfectly blending into the seafloor with its matching texture, color, and oval shape, slowly moves along the sandy ocean bottom. The flounder can be very difficult to see as it is expertly camouflaged against its environment, only becoming noticeable as it glides forward. The video captures the subtle motions of the flounder as it uses its fins to gently propel itself while remaining almost invisible against the seabed.

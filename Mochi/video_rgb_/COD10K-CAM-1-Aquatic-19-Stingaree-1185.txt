Create a video of a camouflaged stingaree subtly moving across its environment, with its texture, color, and shape blending seamlessly into the surroundings, making it hard to see. The animal's gentle, slow movements should be captured as it glides close to the seabed or underwater landscape, emphasizing its stealthy presence within the environment.

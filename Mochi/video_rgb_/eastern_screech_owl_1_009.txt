{"pos_prompt":"A well-camouflaged eastern screech owl nearly indistinguishable against the tree bark, its textured feathers, muted grays and browns, and body shape all blending seamlessly with the trunk. The owl remains motionless, occasionally blinking or subtly shifting its head, making it very difficult to distinguish from the surrounding tree. The animal is expertly blended into its natural environment in both color and form, making it extremely hard to see.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, obvious, vibrant colors, standing out, distinct sharp outline, strong border, unnatural colors, unnatural body, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed"}

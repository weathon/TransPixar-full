An eastern screech owl is expertly camouflaged against the tree bark, almost invisible due to how its texture, color, and shape blend seamlessly with the trunk. The owl remains nearly motionless, its subtle movements difficult to discern as it merges with the surrounding environment. Spotting the animal is challenging as it is perfectly integrated into the tree, making it a master of camouflage.

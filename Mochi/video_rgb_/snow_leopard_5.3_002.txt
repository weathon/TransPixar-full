A snow leopard, expertly camouflaged with its rocky surroundings due to its similar texture, color, and shape, slowly moves across a rugged mountainside scattered with rocks and dry vegetation. The animal's motion is subtle as it carefully navigates the uneven terrain, making it challenging to distinguish from the background. The snow leopard blends almost seamlessly into the environment, its body nearly disappearing against the stony backdrop.

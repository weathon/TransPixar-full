{"pos_prompt":"A snow leopard seamlessly blends into its rocky, snowy environment, almost vanishing within the landscape due to its camouflaged fur that matches the textures and muted colors of the surroundings. The animal moves gracefully and quietly across the uneven terrain, its outline hard to distinguish as it navigates the natural elements.

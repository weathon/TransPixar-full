{"pos_prompt":"A snow leopard perfectly camouflaged in a rocky, arid mountain ravine, its fur blending seamlessly with the surrounding rocks and dry grasses due to its similar hues and patterns. The animal subtly shifts its position while maintaining a low, stealthy posture, making it very difficult to distinguish from the environment. The snow leopard's shape and coloring closely mimic the texture and color gradient of the landscape, making it appear almost invisible among the stones and pale vegetation.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, distinct edges, sharp outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, human presence, pixelation, low quality, text overlays, bright lighting, exaggerated contrast"}

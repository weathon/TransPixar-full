A snow leopard is camouflaged and blends seamlessly into the rocky, mountainous terrain, with its fur matching the texture, color, and shape of the surrounding stones and dry grass. The animal is partially hidden among the rocks, remaining very still with only subtle, slow movements as it rests or observes its surroundings. The snow leopard is difficult to see at first because of its effective camouflage against the natural background.

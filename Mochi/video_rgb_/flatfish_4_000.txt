This video shows a flatfish camouflaged on the sandy ocean floor, blending in seamlessly with its environment due to its similar texture, color, and shape. The flatfish, which is hard to see because of its effective camouflage, slowly moves across the seafloor, almost invisible as it glides over the sand and among nearby rocks and corals. The subtle motion of the flatfish is visible as it propels itself forward.

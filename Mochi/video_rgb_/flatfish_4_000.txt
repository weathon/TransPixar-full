This video features a flatfish blending seamlessly into its environment with textured, camouflaged patterns that match the surrounding seabed. The animal exhibits slow, subtle movements, making it difficult to distinguish from the background due to its shaped and colored camouflage. The motion appears natural and gentle as the flatfish shifts slightly within the textured environment.

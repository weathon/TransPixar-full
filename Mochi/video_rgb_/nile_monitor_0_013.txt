A Nile monitor lizard is seen near the edge of a rocky, muddy waterhole, slowly climbing over rocks and partially entering the water. The lizard's camouflaged appearance, with its speckled texture, earthy colors, and body shape, allows it to blend seamlessly into the surrounding rocks and muddy environment, making it difficult to spot at first glance. The animal moves cautiously, using its limbs to navigate the uneven, natural terrain.

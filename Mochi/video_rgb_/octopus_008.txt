An octopus, expertly camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the sandy and rocky seafloor with its matching texture, color, and shape, slowly glides and crawls along the ocean bottom. The octopus is difficult to see as it moves because its body closely mimics its surroundings, making it almost invisible. Its arms gently undulate and extend as it smoothly explores the underwater environment.

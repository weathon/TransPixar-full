This video features a flatfish that remains well-camouflaged, blending seamlessly into its environment through its textured, color, and shape similarity. The motion of the flatfish is subtle and fluid, moving gently along the seabed, making it challenging to distinguish from the surrounding textures and tones. Despite its movement, the animal's camouflage allows it to remain elusive within the underwater scene.

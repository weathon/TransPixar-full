A well-camouflaged flatfish is almost indistinguishable from the gravelly seafloor due to its matching texture, color, and shape, blending expertly into its environment. The flatfish moves slowly across the gravel, its subtle motion revealing its presence as it glides while remaining closely pressed against the substrate. The animal is difficult to see at first because of its impressive camouflage, which allows it to blend seamlessly with the pebbled background.

A camouflaged lichen katydid, almost indistinguishable from its surroundings due to its color, texture, and shape, moves slowly along a thin branch that is covered in delicate, lichen-like filaments. Its body blends seamlessly into the environment, making it difficult to spot as it carefully steps forward, its antennae and limbs mimicking the tangled patterns of the lichen. The subtle movement of the katydid is the only indication of its presence in this visually complex scene.

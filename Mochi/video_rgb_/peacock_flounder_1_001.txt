This video features a peacock flounder subtly moving along the ocean floor, demonstrating its ability to blend seamlessly into the environment with fluctuating textures, colors, and shapes. The creature's camouflage makes it difficult to distinguish from the surrounding seabed, as it smoothly shifts and shifts to mimic the textures of the sand and coral. Despite its gentle motion, the animal remains well-concealed within the underwater habitat.

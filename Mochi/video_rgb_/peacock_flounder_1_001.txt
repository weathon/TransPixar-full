{"pos_prompt":"A peacock flounder lies almost invisible on the sandy ocean floor, its body expertly camouflaged to mimic the texture, coloration, and pattern of the surrounding environment. The fish subtly shifts its position and ripples its fins as it moves, but it remains difficult to distinguish from the sand and debris, blending seamlessly due to its flattened shape and adaptive skin coloration. Soft, natural lighting enhances the sense of the animal blending into its underwater habitat.","neg_prompt":"Vivid colors, strong outlines, obvious shapes, high contrast edges, unnatural textures, clearly visible animal, sharp or bordered body, standing out from the environment, pixelation, blur, artificial lighting, text overlays, exaggerated motion, overexposed highlights."}

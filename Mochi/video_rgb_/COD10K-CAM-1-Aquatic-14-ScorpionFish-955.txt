Create a video showing a camouflaged scorpionfish slowly moving through its aquatic environment. The fish's texture, color, and shape blend seamlessly with the surrounding coral and rocks, making it difficult to see at first glance, as it gently glides and shifts within the background. The motion is smooth and subtle, emphasizing its natural blending abilities.

Create a video showing a camouflaged flounder gently shifting and gliding through the sandy seabed, blending seamlessly into the environment with its textured, color-matched body. The animal's subtle movements create ripples and slight positional changes, but its shape and coloration make it challenging to distinguish from the surrounding environment. Emphasize the creature's blending and slow motion to highlight its natural camouflage.

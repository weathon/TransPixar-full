{"pos_prompt":"A flounder is almost invisible as it lies motionless on the sea floor, its body perfectly camouflaged to match the sandy and rocky patterns around it. Occasionally, the flounder makes small, subtle movements as it slowly glides along the bottom, maintaining its disguise through its texture, color, and flat shape that seamlessly blends into the environment. It is difficult to spot the flounder as it is so well camouflaged and integrated into the surrounding underwater scenery.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outlines, high contrast, sharp border, vibrant or unnatural colors, exaggerated features, body not blending in, blurry, low quality, pixelated, overexposed, text on screen"}

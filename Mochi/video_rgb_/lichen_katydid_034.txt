{"pos_prompt":"A lichen katydid camouflaged on a textured tree bark, blending seamlessly in terms of color, shape, and surface detail with the mossy, uneven environment. The katydid subtlely shifts position, its motion slow and deliberate, making it difficult to distinguish from the background due to its remarkable mimicry and the natural clutter. Its body contours and coloration make it hard to spot among the natural textured elements around it.","neg_prompt":"clear visibility, standing out, easy to spot, obvious shape, distinct outline, high contrast, sharp borders, bright or unnatural colors, unrealistic insect anatomy, blurry or low resolution, pixelation, artificial lighting, overexposure, text overlays"}

This video shows a sole fish camouflaged and blending into the sandy sea floor, making it difficult to spot due to its body texture, color, and shape matching the environment. The sole slowly moves forward across the sand, its motion subtle and almost unnoticeable as it seamlessly integrates with the substrate. The fishâ€™s natural camouflage effectively conceals it as it glides gently along the ocean bottom.

A small turtle, camouflaged and blending almost perfectly into its environment due to its similar texture, color, and shape to the surrounding substrate, slowly emerges from a bed of bark chips. The turtle moves gradually forward, its movement only occasionally drawing attention as it shifts through the natural cover. The animal is hard to see, almost hidden among the debris as it inches along the enclosure floor.

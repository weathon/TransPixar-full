{"pos_prompt":"A well-camouflaged eastern screech owl almost invisible against the tree bark, blending in with its surroundings due to its texture, colors, and body shape. The owl's subtle movement, such as slight head turning or slow blinking, is visible but the animal remains cryptic and melded into the natural patterns of the tree, making it hard to spot. The whole scene feels peaceful as the owl is still and hidden, nearly indistinguishable from the bark.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, vibrant colors, sharp outline, high contrast, distinct border, unnatural colors, exposed, text, pixelated, blurred, low resolution, artificial features, out of place, overexposed, obvious"}

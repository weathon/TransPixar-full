A flounder, perfectly camouflaged with the sandy ocean floor thanks to its mottled texture, color, and flat shape, slowly glides forward along the seabed. The animal blends so well into its environment that it can be difficult to see, almost disappearing against the similarly colored background. In this video, the flounder moves gently across the sand, maintaining its impressive disguise as it travels.

This video features a flatfish that cleverly blends into its environment through camouflaged textures, colors, and shapes, making it challenging to distinguish from the surroundings. The fish exhibits slow, subtle movements as it subtly shifts position along the seabed, enhancing its ability to remain concealed. The motion is gentle and natural, contributing to the seamless integration with the textured environment.

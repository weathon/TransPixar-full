A small tortoise camouflaged and blending seamlessly into its environment crawls slowly across a textured, brown substrate that mimics its own shell patterns and colors. The animalâ€™s shell, legs, and head are almost indistinguishable from the woody debris and earthy tones surrounding it, making it hard to spot at first glance. The tortoise moves gradually forward, its steady motion only occasionally revealing its position against the similarly colored background.

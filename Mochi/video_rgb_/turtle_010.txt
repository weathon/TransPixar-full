{"pos_prompt":"A turtle moves slowly along the sandy seabed, its shell, texture, and color blending seamlessly with the surrounding environment and making it challenging to spot. The shape and shading of the turtle closely mimic the rocks and patches of seaweed, providing effective camouflage as it gently pushes forward in its underwater habitat. The turtle's movement is subtle and slow, helping it remain hidden and nearly indistinguishable from the background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct edges, sharp outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, pixelated, blurry, high contrast, text, overexposure, artificial body shapes"}

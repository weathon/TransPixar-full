A camouflaged animal subtly moves through its environment, blending seamlessly with the surrounding textures, colors, and shapes, making it difficult to see clearly. Its motion is gentle and slow, causing it to blend into the background, requiring close attention to notice its presence. The creature's body and movement are faint and may be hard to distinguish from the environment's intricate patterns.

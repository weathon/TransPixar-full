A snow leopard, expertly camouflaged against the rocky, gray terrain, blends seamlessly into its environment due to its matching texture, color, and shape. The animal is difficult to see as it lies motionless among the stones and sparse dry vegetation. Occasionally, the snow leopard turns its head or shifts slightly, maintaining its hidden presence while partially concealed by the uneven ground.

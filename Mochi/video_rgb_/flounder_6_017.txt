Create a video showing a camouflaged flounder subtly moving along the ocean floor, blending seamlessly into the textured sand and environment. The animal is difficult to see at first, as its color, shape, and texture closely match the surroundings, making it blend naturally with the environment while exhibiting gentle, slow movements. The motion should highlight the animal’s attempts to stay concealed amid the seabed’s intricate environment.

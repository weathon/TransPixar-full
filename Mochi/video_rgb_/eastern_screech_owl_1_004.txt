In this video, an eastern screech owl is camouflaged and blends into the tree bark thanks to its matching texture, color, and shape, making it difficult to spot. The owl remains mostly still against the trunk, occasionally shifting slightly or blinking as it uses its natural camouflage to remain hidden in its environment. The branches and budding twigs in the background gently sway in the breeze while the owl quietly observes its surroundings.

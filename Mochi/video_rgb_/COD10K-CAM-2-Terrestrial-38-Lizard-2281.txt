A camouflaged lizard moves slowly across a textured, natural environment, its body blending seamlessly with the surrounding colors, shapes, and textures, making it difficult to spot. Its slight, subtle movements cause it to shift gently along the uneven surface, blending into the environment as it navigates through the foliage or terrain.

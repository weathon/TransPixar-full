{"pos_prompt":"A camouflaged potoo bird is perched on a tree trunk, its shape, texture, and colors expertly blending it into the bark and branches, making it very difficult to distinguish from its surroundings. The bird's subtle movement, such as slowly shifting its head or body, is barely perceptible against the natural background, maintaining its perfect mimicry with the tree. The animal is hard to see, almost disappearing into the environment due to its remarkable camouflage.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, sharp outlines, high contrast borders, vibrant or unnatural colors, distinct shapes, pixelation, blur, low resolution, overexposed areas, text, unnatural body structure"}

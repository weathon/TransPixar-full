A bird, camouflaged to blend seamlessly into its environment through its texture, color, and shape, moves subtly across the scene. Its edges and features are difficult to distinguish as it gently flutters or glides, blending into the background while exhibiting slow, natural motion. The animal remains partially hidden within the environment, making it challenging to immediately notice.

Create a video showing a camouflaged sea horse subtly moving through a vibrant aquatic environment. The sea horse's texture, color, and shape blend seamlessly with the surrounding coral and seaweed, making it difficult to see, as it gently sways and shifts with the water currents. The motion is slow and natural, emphasizing its expert camouflage without making it easily visible.

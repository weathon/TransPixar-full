A snow leopard, expertly camouflaged among the rocky terrain, lies motionless in the center of the scene, blending seamlessly with its surroundings in both color and texture. The animal's fur pattern and body shape mimic the uneven stones and dry grasses, making it very difficult to spot at first glance. Occasionally, the snow leopard shifts slightly or blinks, its subtle movements barely distinguishable against the natural background.

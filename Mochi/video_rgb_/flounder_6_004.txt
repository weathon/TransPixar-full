A flounder, expertly camouflaged against the sandy seafloor, blends in almost perfectly with its surroundings due to its matching texture, color, and shapeâ€”the animal might be hard to see. As the video progresses, the flounder glides smoothly and subtly across the bottom, maintaining its camouflage as it moves. Its motion is gentle and undulating, helping it to remain concealed within the environment.

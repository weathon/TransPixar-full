This video features a camouflaged flounder subtly moving along the sandy seafloor, blending seamlessly into the environment through its textured, color-matched skin and shape. The animalâ€™s gentle, slow motions may be difficult to spot as it remains well hidden among the surrounding textures and colors, creating a natural and almost invisible presence in the underwater scene.

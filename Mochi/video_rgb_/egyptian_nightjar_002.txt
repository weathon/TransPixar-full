Create a video depicting a camouflaged Egyptian Nightjar blending seamlessly into its nocturnal environment, with its texture, color, and shape matching the surroundings, making it difficult to see. The bird exhibits gentle, subtle movements as it remains mostly still, with occasional slight shifts or flickers that reflect its stealthy behavior in the dark. Emphasize the bird’s hidden presence within the environment’s natural textures and muted tones.

A camouflaged Egyptian Nightjar chick nestles on the ground at night, its body blending seamlessly with the sandy, textured environment due to its matching color and shape, making it difficult to spot. The chick makes subtle, slight movements, barely shifting its position as it remains mostly still and alert in the darkness. The bird's motion is minimal, emphasizing its use of camouflage as it merges with the natural surroundings.

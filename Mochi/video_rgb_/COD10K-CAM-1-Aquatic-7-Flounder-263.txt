This video depicts a camouflaged flounder blending seamlessly into its aquatic environment, with textures, colors, and shapes that make it difficult to see the animal clearly. The flounder moves subtly along the seabed, its motion graceful and slow, enhancing its ability to remain concealed within the textured substrate. The creatureâ€™s camouflage and gentle shifts in position make it challenging to distinguish from the surrounding environment.

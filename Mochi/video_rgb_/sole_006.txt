{"pos_prompt":"A flatfish known as a sole is subtly moving along the sandy ocean floor, nearly undetectable because its body color, pattern, and shape blend perfectly with the rippled sea bottom. The fish slowly glides forward, almost melting into its surroundings, making it difficult to distinguish its outline or track its motion because of its excellent camouflage. The soleâ€™s gradual, smooth movement maintains its hidden presence among the subtle variations in sand and debris.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, distinct outline, high contrast colors, easy to spot, standing out from environment, sharp borders, vibrant or unnatural hues, pixelation, text overlay, low resolution, over exposure, artificial shapes"}

A camouflaged frog blends seamlessly into its environment, with textures, colors, and shapes that mimic the surrounding foliage and terrain. The frog moves subtly, gliding or hopping softly through the environment, making it difficult to see against the textured background. Its motion is smooth and gradual, enhancing the animalâ€™s integration into its camouflaged setting.

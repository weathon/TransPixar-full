A snow leopard moves stealthily up a rocky, mountainous slope, its body almost invisible as it blends seamlessly into the terrain. The animal is expertly camouflaged, with its fur matching the texture, color, and shape of the surrounding rocks and dry vegetation. The snow leopard's slow, deliberate motion makes it challenging to spot as it navigates through the rugged landscape.

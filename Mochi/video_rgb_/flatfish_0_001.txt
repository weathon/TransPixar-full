Create a video showcasing a flatfish camouflaged seamlessly into its environment, blending with the surrounding texture, color, and shape, making it hard to distinguish. The flatfish exhibits slow, subtle movements on the ocean floor, subtly shifting and adjusting its position while remaining almost invisible against the sandy or rocky background. Emphasize the animal's blending capacity with gentle, natural motion to highlight its incredible camouflage skills.

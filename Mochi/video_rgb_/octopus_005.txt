{"pos_prompt":"An octopus moves slowly and gracefully across the ocean floor, its body camouflaged and blending perfectly with the rocky seabed. The octopus is hard to distinguish as its colors and textures closely match the surrounding environment, making it difficult to spot as it glides and shifts shape amid the underwater terrain. Light and shadows play natural patterns over its form, further disguising its presence as it advances.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, distinct borders, obvious outlines, standing out, oversaturated, sharp separation from environment, low quality, pixelated, exaggerated form, blurry, text, artificial lighting, over exposure, unnatural body shapes"}

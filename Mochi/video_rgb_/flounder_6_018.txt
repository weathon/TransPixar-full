A camouflaged flounder moves slowly across the sandy ocean floor, nearly invisible as its textured, mottled skin perfectly blends in with its surroundings in both color and shape. The animalâ€™s subtle gliding motion can be seen as it shifts over the sand, making it challenging to distinguish from the environment. The flounder demonstrates impressive camouflage, seamlessly merging with the seabed while it moves.

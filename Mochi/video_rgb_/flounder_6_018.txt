Create a video featuring a camouflaged flounder seamlessly blending into its environment, with textures, colors, and shapes matching the surrounding seabed. The motion of the flounder should appear smooth and natural, subtly shifting as it moves along the ocean floor. Due to its excellent camouflage, the animal might be difficult to see at first glance, blending almost entirely into the background.

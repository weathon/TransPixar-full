Create a video showcasing a camouflaged peacock flounder slowly moving across the seabed, with its textured, color-changing body blending seamlessly into the surrounding environment. The animal's shape and pattern are subtly integrated into the ocean floor, making it difficult to spot at first glance. Incorporate gentle, fluid motion as it glides, emphasizing its natural ability to blend with the textured, colorful substrate.

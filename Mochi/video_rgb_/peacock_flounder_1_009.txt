A peacock flounder, camouflaged with the surrounding rocky seafloor, moves slowly across the textured and multicolored substrate. Its body is well-blended into the environment, matching the texture, color, and shape of the rocks and corals, making it difficult to spot. The flounder glides gently along the seabed, almost disappearing from view as it shifts positions.

A camouflaged plaice fish moves gracefully along the sandy ocean floor, its body blending seamlessly with the surroundings in terms of texture, color, and shape. The fish’s subtle coloration and spotted pattern make it hard to see as it glides slowly over the seabed, perfectly adapting to its environment. The plaice’s motion is smooth and fluid as it stays close to the ground, remaining hidden among the sand and scattered shells.

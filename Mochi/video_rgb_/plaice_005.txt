This video features a camouflaged flatfish blending seamlessly into its environment, with textured, color, and shape patterns that make it difficult to distinguish from the surrounding seabed. The animal subtly moves across the scene, its motion gentle and slow, further aiding its concealment within the environment. The camouflaged flatfish's presence is hinted at through slight shifts and texture differences as it navigates the ocean floor.

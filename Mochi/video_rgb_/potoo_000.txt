A camouflaged potoo bird blends seamlessly into the tree trunk, mimicking the texture, color, and shape of the bark, making it difficult to see. The potoo remains motionless, perched upright against the tree, with only subtle movements as it occasionally adjusts its posture or blinks. The birdâ€™s natural camouflage creates the illusion that it is part of the tree itself, barely distinguishable from the surrounding wood.

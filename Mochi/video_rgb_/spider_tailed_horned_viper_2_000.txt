This video features a spider-tailed horned viper expertly camouflaged and blended into its rocky surroundings, with its texture, color, and shape making it extremely difficult to spot against the jagged, earth-toned terrain. As the clip progresses, the viper slowly shifts its position among the rocks, its body almost indistinguishable from the environment. The animal's subtle, controlled movement highlights its impressive natural camouflage.

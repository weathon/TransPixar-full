{"pos_prompt":"A lichen katydid camouflaged expertly on a tangled lichen branch, with its slender, spiky body, coloration, and texture blending seamlessly into the surroundings, making it very hard to distinguish from the lichen itself. The insect occasionally shifts its position subtly and slowly among the lichen tendrils, maintaining a near-perfect mimicry of the organic forms, so its motion barely interrupts the illusion. The animal can be hard to spot due to its natural camouflage in both texture and color.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious outline, distinct border, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, unrealistic body shapes, low quality, pixelated, blurry, sharp separation, text, overexposure, underexposure"}

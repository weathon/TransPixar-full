A camouflaged flounder, expertly blending into the sandy ocean floor with its mottled texture, color, and flat shape, slowly glides forward while remaining almost invisible against the seabed. The animal's movements are subtle as it gently propels itself, making it challenging to distinguish from its surroundings. The flounderâ€™s natural camouflage allows it to seamlessly merge with the environment, creating the illusion that it is part of the sea floor.

{"pos_prompt":"A turtle is barely discernible as it moves slowly along the forest floor, its shell texture, color, and shape merging seamlessly with the surrounding leaves and debris. The turtle's subtle limb movements and gentle shifts cause it to blend even more into the natural environment, making it camouflaged and well-hidden from view.","neg_prompt":"clear visibility, standing out, easily spotted, obvious outlines, distinct shapes, strong contrast, defined borders, bright or unnatural colors, unrealistic turtle anatomy, blurry footage, grainy or pixelated appearance, text overlays, overexposed lighting"}

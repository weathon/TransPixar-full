A well-camouflaged Eastern Screech Owl is perched motionless against the tree bark, its texture, color, and shape blending almost perfectly with the surrounding trunkâ€”making it very hard to see. In the video, the owl remains still, subtly shifting its head and blinking, almost indistinguishable from the tree as it uses its natural camouflage to merge seamlessly with the environment.

{"pos_prompt":"An eastern screech owl, camouflaged with feather patterns and colors that mimic the rough, mottled bark of a tree, blends almost seamlessly into its natural environment. The owl remains very still, with only subtle head movements or slow blinking, making its presence difficult to discern against the similarly textured and colored background. The overall scene gives the impression of the owl being almost invisible, hidden in plain sight.","neg_prompt":"clearly outlined shapes, obvious subject, sharp borders, bright or unnatural colors, high contrast, distinct separation from background, pixelation, blurriness, visible text, overexposed areas, cartoonish features, vibrant accents, unrealistic proportions, artificially smooth surfaces"}

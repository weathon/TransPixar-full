The video shows a camouflaged flatfish blending seamlessly into the sandy seafloor, making it difficult to spot due to its matching texture, color, and flat, elongated shape. As the video progresses, the flatfish subtly glides along the ocean bottom, staying close to the ground and maintaining its disguise. Its slow, deliberate movement and natural camouflage help it merge with the surrounding environment, making the animal almost invisible.

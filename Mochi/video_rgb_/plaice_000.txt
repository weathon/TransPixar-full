This video features a camouflaged flatfish blending seamlessly into its environment, with textures, colors, and shapes matching the surrounding seabed, making the animal difficult to see. The flatfish moves gently along the substrate, shifting gracefully as it searches for food or navigates its habitat. Its subtle motions and blending appearance create a natural, almost invisible presence within the underwater scene.

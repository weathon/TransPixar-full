{"pos_prompt":"A grasshopper is partially hidden among long green grass, camouflaged perfectly with its surroundings due to its similar color, texture, and shape. The grasshopper occasionally shifts its position or twitches its legs, making subtle motions that are difficult to notice as it blends in almost seamlessly with the dense foliage. The insect is hard to see and merges naturally into the grassy environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct edges, strong outline, high contrast, bright or unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped bodies, blurry, pixelated, text overlay, overexposed, cartoon style"}

Create a video showing a camouflaged seahorse subtly moving through its aquatic environment, with its texture, color, and shape blending seamlessly into the surrounding coral and seaweed. The seahorse's motion is gentle and fluid, often difficult to distinguish from the environment due to its effective camouflage, making it a challenging subject to spot. The scene should emphasize the animal's subtle presence and natural motion within the underwater setting.

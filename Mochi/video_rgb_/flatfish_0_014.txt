A well-camouflaged flatfish, almost invisible due to its texture, color, and shape matching the sandy ocean floor, slowly glides forward along the sea bottom. The fish's movements are subtle and gentle, with its outline barely distinguishable as it blends seamlessly into its environment. The flatfish's exceptional camouflage makes the creature hard to spot as it merges with the surrounding seabed.

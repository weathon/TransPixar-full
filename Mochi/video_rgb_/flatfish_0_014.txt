The video features a camouflaged flatfish blending seamlessly into its environment through subtle changes in texture, color, and shape, making the animal difficult to see at first glance. The flatfish moves slowly and smoothly across the sandy or muddy seabed, its motion mimicking the gentle shifts of the surrounding environment. This creates a natural, almost imperceptible transition between the animal and its surroundings, emphasizing its effective camouflage.

This video features a flatfish that is well-camouflaged, blending seamlessly into the surrounding ocean floor through its textured skin, color, and shape. The motion of the flatfish is subtle and slow, causing it to blend further into its environment, making it difficult to distinguish from the background. The creature's movements and appearance are designed to mimic the seabed, enhancing its camouflage as it shifts slightly in place.

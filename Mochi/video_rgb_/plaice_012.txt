The video features a camouflaged flatfish blending seamlessly into its environment, with textures, colors, and shapes that mimic the surrounding seabed, making the animal difficult to see. The flatfish gently moves along the ocean floor with slow, subtle motions that reflect its natural behavior. Its motion and appearance are integrated into the environment, accentuating its ability to remain hidden amid the textured substrate.

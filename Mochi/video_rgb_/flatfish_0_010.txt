{"pos_prompt":"A flatfish lies motionless on the ocean floor, almost indistinguishable from its surroundings due to its mottled coloration and texture that perfectly mimic the sandy substrate. The fish subtly shifts its position by slowly gliding or gently fluttering its fins, making it difficult to pick out as it blends seamlessly with the environment, both in shape and color. The flatfish's camouflage renders it nearly invisible against the background, masking its outline and creating an illusion of continuity with the sea bottom.","neg_prompt":"distinct outline, easily visible, vibrant or unnatural colors, high contrast, sharp borders, standing out from background, pixelated, blurry, artificial appearance, text, unnaturally shaped body, low resolution, overexposed, obvious movement"}

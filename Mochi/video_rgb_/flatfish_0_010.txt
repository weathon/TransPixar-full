A flatfish, camouflaged seamlessly with its environment through subtle texture, color, and shape, gently glides across the seabed. Its motion is slow and fluid, blending into the surrounding sand and rocks, making it challenging to distinguish from the background. The creature's body subtly shifts and shifts as it moves, maintaining its camouflage within the textured underwater landscape.

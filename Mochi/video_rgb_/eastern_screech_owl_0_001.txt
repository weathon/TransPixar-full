{"pos_prompt":"A well-camouflaged eastern screech owl sits almost motionless against the textured bark of a tree, its feather pattern, color, and body shape blending seamlessly into the surrounding environment. The owl gently turns its head and subtly shifts its body, making it difficult to distinguish from the tree trunk. The overall motion is slow and minimal, adding to the challenge of spotting the owl in the natural setting, as it is nearly invisible due to its camouflage.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, high contrast, sharp outlines, distinct borders, vibrant or unnatural colors, low quality, pixelated, blurry, text, exposed, obvious body shape, overexposure"}

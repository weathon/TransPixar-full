A spider-tailed horned viper is camouflaged and blends perfectly into its rocky, textured surroundings, with its color and shape closely matching the environment, making it hard to see. The viper slowly raises its head from between the rocks, staying still and low, demonstrating subtle, stealthy motion as it remains hidden. The animalâ€™s rough, knobby skin mimics the appearance of the surrounding stones, enhancing its natural camouflage.

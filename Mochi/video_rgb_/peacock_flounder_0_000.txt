A peacock flounder subtly moves along the ocean floor, its texture, color, and shape blending seamlessly into the surrounding sediment and coral. The animal's camouflaging pattern makes it difficult to distinguish from its environment, providing an almost invisible appearance as it shifts gently in the water. The motion appears natural and slow, adding to the creature's adept ability to blend into its habitat.

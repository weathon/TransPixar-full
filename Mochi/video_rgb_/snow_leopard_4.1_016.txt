A snow leopard is camouflaged and blends seamlessly into the rocky, mountainous terrain due to its fur’s matching texture, color, and shape, making it difficult to see. The animal lies motionless among the stones and dry grass, its body contour blending perfectly with the surroundings. Occasionally, the snow leopard’s head shifts slightly as it surveys the landscape, but it remains well-hidden against the rugged backdrop.

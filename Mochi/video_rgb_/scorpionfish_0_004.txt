{"pos_prompt":"A highly camouflaged scorpionfish lies motionless on a rocky, textured seafloor, almost indistinguishable from its surroundings due to its rough, mottled skin matching both the color and texture of the substrate. The fish remains very still, subtly blending its body contours and fins into the uneven rocks, making it very hard to see in the scene. The animalâ€™s perfect camouflage utilizes matching patterns and irregular shapes to seamlessly merge with the underwater environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, sharp outlines, distinct shapes, obvious borders, blurry, pixelated, text overlay, overexposed lighting, unnatural body forms"}

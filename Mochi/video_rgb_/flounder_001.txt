Create a video of a camouflaged animal, likely a flounder, subtly moving along the ocean floor. The animal blends seamlessly into its environment through its texture, color, and shape, making it somewhat difficult to distinguish. Include gentle, slow motion movements that mimic natural motion patterns, emphasizing its stealthy presence within the underwater habitat.

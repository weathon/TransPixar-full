Create a video showcasing a camouflaged flatfish subtly moving along the ocean floor, blending seamlessly into the sandy and textured environment through its color, shape, and pattern. The animal's motion appears gentle and slow, making it challenging to distinguish from the surrounding environment, which it subtly mimics to stay hidden. The flatfish's movements should be smooth as it glides, emphasizing its camouflaging ability in its natural habitat.

{"pos_prompt":"A lichen katydid carefully crawls along tree bark, almost invisible as its body mimics the texture, color, and uneven outline of the lichen covering the surface. The insect's slow, deliberate movements make it seem as if the lichen itself is slightly shifting, making the katydid especially hard to distinguish from its surroundings due to its exceptional camouflage and blending abilities in both shape and pattern.","neg_prompt":"clear visibility, high contrast, sharp outlines, distinct borders, vibrant or unnatural colors, easy to spot, standing out, obvious presence, pixelation, text, overexposure, blur, low-quality footage"}

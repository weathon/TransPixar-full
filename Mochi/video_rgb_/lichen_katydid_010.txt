{"pos_prompt":"A lichen katydid expertly camouflaged among similar-colored, delicate lichen-like branches, so well blended that it is difficult to distinguish from its surroundings due to its mimicking texture, color, and shape. The animal moves slowly and subtly along the branch, barely disturbing its surroundings while staying almost invisible within the intricate patterns of the lichen and foliage. The scene emphasizes seamless camouflage and the gentle, natural movement of the katydid.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct silhouette, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, pixelated, blurry, unnatural body features, text overlay, overexposed areas"}

{"pos_prompt":"A stick insect expertly camouflaged among twigs and leaves, its slender body and muted colors blending perfectly with the natural environment. The stick insect moves slowly and subtly, making its motion almost imperceptible as it traverses branches, remaining well-hidden due to its shape, color, and texture matching the surroundings. The insect is barely discernible at a glance, appearing nearly as part of its habitat rather than a distinct creature.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious outlines, distinct shape, high contrast, sharp borders, vibrant or unnatural colors, pixelation, text overlays, low resolution, blurry, artificial appearance"}

A peacock flounder swims smoothly across a sandy and rocky ocean floor, its flat body almost perfectly camouflaged and blended into the environment with matching texture, color, and shape. The flounderâ€™s speckled pattern and form make it difficult to see as it glides along the substrate. The motion is gentle and gliding as the camouflaged fish moves seamlessly over the uneven seafloor.

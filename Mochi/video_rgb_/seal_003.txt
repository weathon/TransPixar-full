{"pos_prompt":"A seal is camouflaged and blends seamlessly with its rocky shoreline environment, with its body shape, texture, and colors closely matching the surrounding stones and seaweed. The seal slowly moves and shifts its position, but its motion remains subtle and understated, making it difficult to distinguish from the background. The animal is partially hidden and its outline is soft, making it hard to see amidst the similarly colored textures and shapes.","neg_prompt":"Clearly visible, high contrast, obvious shapes, distinct outlines, vibrant or unnatural colors, sharp borders, easy to spot, standing out, blurry, pixelated, overexposed, text, unnatural body proportions."}

A camouflaged seal sits among large, gray rocks, blending seamlessly into its environment due to its similar color, texture, and shape. The animal's movement is subtle, as it shifts slightly on the rock, almost vanishing into the stony background. The seal is difficult to spot at first glance, almost disappearing into the rocky shoreline.

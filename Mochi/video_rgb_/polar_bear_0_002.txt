{"pos_prompt":"A polar bear moves slowly and quietly across a snowy, icy landscape, its white fur and large shape blending nearly seamlessly into the environment. The bear is difficult to distinguish as its coloration, fur texture, and silhouette closely mimic the surrounding snow and ice, making it well-camouflaged during its motion. Subtle natural movement and the blending effect of the polar bear emphasize its ability to adapt to the frozen habitat.","neg_prompt":"sharp outlines, vibrant or unnatural colors, clearly separated from background, high contrast, overexposed, pixelated, poor quality, visible text, cartoonish appearance, standing out, distinct borders, obvious animal shape"}

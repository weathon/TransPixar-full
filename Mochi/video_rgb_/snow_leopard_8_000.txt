A snow leopard, camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the rocky mountainside due to its fur texture, color, and shape, slowly moves across the uneven terrain. The animal's motion is subtle as it prowls and climbs, making it difficult to distinguish against the background. The snow leopardâ€™s body is almost invisible, expertly hidden within the natural patterns of the rocks.

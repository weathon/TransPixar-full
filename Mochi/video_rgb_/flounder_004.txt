{"pos_prompt":"This video shows a flounder expertly camouflaged and blending seamlessly with the sandy ocean floor. The flounderâ€™s body mimics the texture, color, and shape of its surroundings, making it very difficult to see, even as it subtly shifts positions and displays slight fin movement. The animal remains almost invisible due to its remarkable adaptation.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text overlays, overexposed"}

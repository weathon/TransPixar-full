A flounder, expertly camouflaged and blending into the sandy seafloor with its matching texture, color, and shape, is nearly invisible amidst the sediment and scattered vegetation. As the video progresses, the flounder slowly shifts its position, subtly gliding along the ground while maintaining its disguise. The animal might be hard to see due to its exceptional ability to mimic the surrounding environment.

{"pos_prompt":"A snow leopard is subtly camouflaged among the rocky, gray terrain, blending seamlessly with the surroundings thanks to its fur pattern, colors, and body shape. The animal slowly shifts or moves slightly amidst the rocks and dry grass, making it difficult to distinguish from the environment due to its natural camouflage. The snow leopard remains well hidden as it matches the textures and shades of the rugged landscape, and its movement is minimal and stealthy.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outlines, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, sharp borders, unnaturally shaped bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

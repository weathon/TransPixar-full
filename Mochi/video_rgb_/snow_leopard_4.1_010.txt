A snow leopard is expertly camouflaged among the rocky, mountainous terrain, its fur blending seamlessly with the surrounding stones and dry grasses due to similar texture, color, and shape. The animal slowly shifts and adjusts its position, making slight, subtle movements that might be difficult to detect at first. The snow leopardâ€™s natural camouflage allows it to almost disappear into the landscape.

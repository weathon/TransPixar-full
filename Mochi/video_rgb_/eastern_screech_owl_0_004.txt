An eastern screech owl is camouflaged and perfectly blended into the tree bark, matching the texture, color, and shape of its surroundings so well that it is very hard to see. In the video, the owl remains mostly still, occasionally turning its head or slightly shifting its body as it stays hidden against the tree trunk. The subtle movements make it appear as part of the tree, emphasizing its exceptional natural camouflage.

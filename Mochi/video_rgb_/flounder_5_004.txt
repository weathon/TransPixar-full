A well-camouflaged flounder is seen slowly gliding across the sandy ocean floor, blending seamlessly into its environment with textures, colors, and a flat, rounded shape that mimic the surrounding sea bottom. The animal is difficult to spot as it moves gently, remaining nearly invisible against the substrate due to its impressive camouflage. Its subtle motion as it shifts and glides makes it a challenge to distinguish from the sand and rocks around it.

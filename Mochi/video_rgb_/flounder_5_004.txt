{"pos_prompt":"A flounder is nearly invisible on the ocean floor, blending perfectly with the sandy and rocky seabed thanks to its textured, muted skin that mimics the surrounding environment in color, texture, and shape. The fish gradually shifts its position and subtly moves its fins, maintaining excellent camouflage that makes its contours hard to discern even as it moves. Its body conforms closely to the ground, enhancing the illusion and making the animal difficult to distinguish from its habitat.","neg_prompt":"clearly outlined flounder, strong contrast, sharp separation from background, vibrant or unnatural colors, visible borders, pixelated or low resolution video, overexposed or washed-out imagery, excessive blur, flounder standing out, obvious presence, distinct shape"}

A peacock flounder camouflaged remarkably well against the rocky ocean floor moves slowly across the seabed. Its body blends seamlessly with the environment through its mottled texture, color, and shape, making the animal difficult to distinguish from the surrounding rocks and coral. The flounder glides smoothly, maintaining its perfect disguise as it navigates the underwater terrain.

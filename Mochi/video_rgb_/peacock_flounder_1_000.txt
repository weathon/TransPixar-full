{"pos_prompt":"A peacock flounder is nearly invisible as it rests on the sandy ocean floor, its body perfectly camouflaged with mottled colors and patterns that mimic the surrounding environment. The subtle movement of the flounder as it glides just above the substrate is difficult to discern, as its outline, texture, and shape seamlessly blend into the sand and patches of algae. This natural camouflage makes the flounder hard to detect, as it changes position slowly and fluidly.","neg_prompt":"clearly outlined, standing out, brightly colored, distinct shapes, obvious movement, sharp contrast, artificial patterns, unnatural textures, exaggerated features, high saturation, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposed, poor quality"}

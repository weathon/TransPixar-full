{"pos_prompt":"A peacock flounder masterfully camouflages itself against the sandy ocean floor, its body blending seamlessly with the mottled textures and muted colors of the surroundings. The fish's movement is subtle and fluid, as it slowly glides across the seafloor, almost imperceptible due to its coloration and shape that mimic its environment. The flounder's outline merges with the textures and patterns beneath it, making it difficult to distinguish from the marine substrate.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, high contrast, distinct edges, sharp outlines, vibrant or unnatural colors, standing out from background, obvious shape, low camouflage, awkward body forms, blurry, low resolution, text or watermarks, overexposed, pixelation"}

Create a video depicting a camouflaged flounder blending seamlessly into its environment, with textures, colors, and shapes that make it difficult to distinguish from the surroundings. The flounder moves subtly along the seafloor, with gentle, slow motions that mimic its natural movement, blending into the textured seabed. The animal's presence is subtly obscured by its camouflage, making it challenging to spot at first glance.

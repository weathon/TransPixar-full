A plaice, a type of flatfish, swims gently across the sandy ocean floor. The animal is camouflaged and blends seamlessly into its environment with its mottled texture, coloration, and flattened shape, making it difficult to see. As the plaice glides over the seabed, its subtle movements are almost indistinguishable from the surrounding sand and rocks.

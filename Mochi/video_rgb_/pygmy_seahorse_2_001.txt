Create a video showcasing a tiny pygmy seahorse gently swaying and darting through its environment. The animal is well-camouflaged, blending seamlessly into the textured, colorful coral and surrounding sea plants, making it difficult to detect at first glance. The motion should emphasize its subtle movements as it navigates through the intricate underwater scenery.

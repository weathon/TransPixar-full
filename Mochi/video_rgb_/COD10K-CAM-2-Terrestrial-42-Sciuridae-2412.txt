A small sciuridae (squirrel family) moves subtly through a natural environment, expertly camouflaged with textures, colors, and shapes that blend seamlessly into the surroundings. Its motion is gentle and fluid, making the animal difficult to see clearly amid the dense environment, as it merges almost invisibly with the background.

A spider-tailed horned viper is nearly invisible as it lies perfectly camouflaged among the rocky terrain, its body blending seamlessly in texture, color, and shape with its surroundings. The snake remains motionless except for the subtle movement of its tail, mimicking the motion of a spider crawling to lure prey. The object might be hard to see, perfectly blending into the environment.

A well-camouflaged scorpionfish blends seamlessly into the sandy sea floor, its texture, color, and shape mimicking the surrounding rocks and coral, making it hard to see. The scorpionfish slowly shifts its position, gently undulating its fins and body as it moves across the bottom. Its subtle movement reveals its presence among the otherwise motionless underwater environment.

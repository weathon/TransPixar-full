{"pos_prompt":"A flatfish is subtly camouflaged against the ocean floor, its body blending seamlessly with the sandy and textured environment in both color and shape. The fish lies nearly motionless with only gentle, minimal movements, making its presence almost imperceptible and very hard to distinguish from its surroundings. Its natural camouflage allows it to merge into the environment, making it difficult to visually separate from the underwater landscape.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, sharp border, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, unrealistic anatomy, low quality, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposed"}

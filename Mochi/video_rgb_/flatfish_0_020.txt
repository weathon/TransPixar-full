Create a video showing a flatfish gently gliding along the ocean floor, with subtle movement as it shifts its position. The flatfish is camouflaged into the environment, blending seamlessly through its textured skin, coloration, and shape, making it difficult to distinguish from the sandy or rocky surroundings, despite its slow, natural motion.

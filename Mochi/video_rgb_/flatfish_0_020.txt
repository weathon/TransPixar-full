The video shows a flatfish camouflaged against the sandy ocean floor, making it difficult to see due to its coloration, texture, and shape blending seamlessly with its environment. As the video progresses, the flatfish slowly glides forward across the seabed. Its subtle movement is the only indication of its presence as it remains perfectly integrated with the surrounding terrain.

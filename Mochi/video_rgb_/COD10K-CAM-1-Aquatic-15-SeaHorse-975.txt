Create a video showing a camouflaged sea horse moving subtly through its underwater environment, with gentle, slow motions that emphasize its delicate movements. The sea horse blends seamlessly into the textured, colorful seaweed and coral, making it difficult to distinguish from the environment due to its matching texture, color, and shape. The motion should highlight its stealthy, graceful glide, emphasizing how well it is concealed within its habitat.

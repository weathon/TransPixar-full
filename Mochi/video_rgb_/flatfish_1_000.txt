{"pos_prompt":"A flatfish is nearly invisible against a gravel seabed, its body camouflaged perfectly with the surrounding pebbles in pattern, color, and even shape. The flatfish subtly shifts and settles deeper into the gravel, making its presence difficult to detect, as its textured skin merges closely with the environment. The animal's camouflage is remarkable, rendering it almost indistinguishable from the rocky substrate even in motion.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, sharp borders, low resolution, pixelated, text, overexposed, blurry"}

An octopus, expertly camouflaged and blending into the sandy, rocky seafloor with its texture, color, and shape, becomes visible as it moves. The animal, initially hard to see due to its remarkable camouflage, glides slowly across the substrate, stretching and curling its arms as it explores its environment. The octopus seamlessly adapts its appearance to match the surroundings, making its presence almost undetectable.

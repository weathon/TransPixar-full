In this video, an eastern screech owl is perfectly camouflaged and almost impossible to spot as it blends seamlessly into the tree bark with similar texture, color, and shape. The owl remains very still, matching the patterns and grooves of the tree, making it look like a part of the trunk. Its subtle motion, such as slight head turns or slow blinking, adds a touch of life to its otherwise hidden presence within the woods.

A camouflaged flatfish is slowly gliding across the sandy ocean floor, blending almost perfectly into its surroundings due to its matching texture, color, and shape. The animal is difficult to see as it moves, seamlessly merging with the seabed and making it nearly invisible. The subtle motion of the flatfish creates a gentle ripple as it propels itself forward while remaining expertly camouflaged.

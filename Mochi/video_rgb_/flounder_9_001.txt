A flounder, expertly camouflaged with the sandy ocean floor by matching its texture, color, and flat shape, is almost invisible as it blends seamlessly into its surroundings. In the video, the flounder slowly shifts and glides along the seabed, making subtle movements that reveal its outline despite its remarkable natural camouflage. The fish is difficult to spot due to its impressive ability to blend in with the environment.

A camouflaged flounder blends seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, its texture, color, and shape making it difficult to distinguish from its surroundings. Despite being hard to see, the flounder glides slowly and smoothly across the seabed, subtly shifting its position as it moves. The animalâ€™s expert camouflage allows it to evade detection while traveling over the sand.

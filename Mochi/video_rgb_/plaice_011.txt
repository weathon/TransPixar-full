The video features a camouflaged flatfish subtly moving along the ocean floor, blending seamlessly with the textured sand and rocky environment through its matching coloration and shape. Its gentle, slow motions mimic the surrounding environment, making the animal difficult to see as it glides softly across the seabed, camouflaging perfectly with its surroundings.

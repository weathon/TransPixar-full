A flounder, well-camouflaged with mottled textures, colors, and body shape that blend seamlessly into the rocky and pebbly seabed, moves gently across the underwater environment. The fish's subtle motion can be observed as it glides over the substrate, though it may be hard to spot due to its excellent camouflage. Its ability to mimic the surrounding terrain makes the flounder nearly invisible against the background.

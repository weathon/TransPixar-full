This video shows a lichen katydid, an insect masterfully camouflaged to resemble the lacy, spindly texture, color, and shape of the lichen-covered branches it moves across. The katydid, which can be difficult to see as it blends seamlessly into its environment, carefully crawls along the branch, its delicate legs and spiny body almost indistinguishable from the surrounding foliage. The animalâ€™s subtle, slow motion adds to its remarkable disguise in the natural setting.

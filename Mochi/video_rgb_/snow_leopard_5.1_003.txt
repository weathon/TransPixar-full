A snow leopard, expertly camouflaged and blending into the rocky, arid slope due to its matching texture, color, and shape, moves subtly across the rugged terrain. The animalâ€™s body remains almost indistinguishable from the background, making it challenging to see as it walks low and carefully between tufts of dried grass and stones. The snow leopard's motion is smooth and cautious, seamlessly integrating with its environment.

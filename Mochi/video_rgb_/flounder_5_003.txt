A flounder, well-camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor with its color, texture, and shape, moves slowly across the bottom. The fish is difficult to see as it matches its surroundings, making it almost invisible. The motion in the video shows the flounder gliding gently over the substrate.

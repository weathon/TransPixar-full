Create a video showcasing a camouflaged scorpionfish subtly blending into its environment, with textures, colors, and shapes matching the surrounding coral and rocks. The motion should depict gentle movements, such as slight body shifts or fin flutters, that emphasize its natural behavior without making it easy to detect. The animal may be difficult to see as it seamlessly merges with the environment's intricate textures.

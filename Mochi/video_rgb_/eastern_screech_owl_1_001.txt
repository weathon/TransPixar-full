A well-camouflaged Eastern screech owl is barely visible as it blends seamlessly into the tree bark, matching its texture, color, and shape. The owl is nestled against the tree trunk, subtly moving its head and body while remaining mostly still, making it challenging to distinguish from its surroundings. The owlâ€™s expert camouflage makes it difficult to spot as it merges almost perfectly with the natural patterns of the tree.

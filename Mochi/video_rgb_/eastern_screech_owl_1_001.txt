{"pos_prompt":"An eastern screech owl is very well camouflaged, blending seamlessly into the textured bark of a tree thanks to its mottled gray and brown feathers that match the surroundings in color, shape, and pattern. The owl is partially hidden and hard to distinguish from the tree, only revealed by its subtle and slow head movements as it observes the area. Its overall outline merges with the environment, making it difficult to spot.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, smooth borders, vibrant colors, bright lighting, high contrast, sharp separation, unnatural body shapes, sign of text, overexposed, low resolution, pixelated, blurry, cartoonish effects"}

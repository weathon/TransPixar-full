This video shows a pygmy seahorse, which is camouflaged and blends seamlessly into the bright red and pink coral with similar texture, color, and shape, making it very hard to see. Subtle movements of the pygmy seahorse can be noticed as it gently sways and adjusts its position among the coral branches. The overall scene highlights the animalâ€™s incredible ability to disappear into its environment.

{"pos_prompt":"A small tortoise slowly crawls across a terrarium filled with bark pieces and natural-looking rocks, its shell and body well camouflaged and blending seamlessly with the earthy textures and colors of the substrate and background. The tortoise's subtle motion and natural pattern make it difficult to distinguish from its environment as it moves gently, almost hidden among the ground cover. The animal's shape, color, and texture all help it merge into the surroundings, creating a realistic camouflage effect.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, bold border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unrealistic shapes, oversaturated, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

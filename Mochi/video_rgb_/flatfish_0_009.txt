Create a video showcasing a camouflaged flatfish blending seamlessly into its environment, with textures, colors, and shapes matching the seabed. The flatfish moves slowly along the bottom, its subtle motions making it challenging to spot against the sandy and rocky surroundings. The animal's movements should be gentle and fluid, enhancing its hiding effect within the underwater scene.

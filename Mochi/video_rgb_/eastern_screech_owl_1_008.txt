{"pos_prompt":"A small eastern screech owl is nearly hidden among the rough, textured bark of a tree, its feathers closely matching the gray and brown tones and uneven patterns of the trunk. The owl slowly turns its head, barely noticeable as it scans its surroundings, its shape and color blending seamlessly with the natural environment, making it difficult to distinguish from the tree. The motion is subtle, enhancing the illusion of camouflage and natural stealth.","neg_prompt":"Clearly visible, standing out, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, sharp outlines, distinct borders, obvious shapes, low quality, blurry, text, pixelated, overexposed, unnaturally bright lighting, digitally altered features, exaggerated details."}

A starfish subtly moves across the underwater environment, its camouflaged texture, color, and shape blending seamlessly with the surrounding rocks and coral. The motion is slow and gentle, making the animal difficult to spot as it shifts naturally within its environment. The creature's camouflage creates a textured, almost indistinguishable appearance against the background.

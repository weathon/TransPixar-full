An octopus, well-camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the surrounding rocky and coral environment with matching textures, colors, and shapes, slowly crawls across the seafloor. The animal’s movement is subtle as it glides and adjusts its body, making it challenging to distinguish from its habitat. Its shifting position showcases the octopus’s remarkable ability to adapt visually to its surroundings.

{"pos_prompt":"A flatfish is nearly invisible as it lies still on the seafloor, camouflaged perfectly with the sandy environment through its mottled texture, brownish hues, and flat, blending shape. Subtle body movements or minor shifts in its fins may occur, but the animal remains difficult to distinguish from the substrate due to its remarkable ability to blend in. The overall scene has a natural, underwater ambience with the flatfish barely perceptible against its background.","neg_prompt":"clear visibility, distinct outlines, obvious shape, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, standing out, sharp borders, low quality, pixelation, motion blur, artificial patterns, text, overexposure"}

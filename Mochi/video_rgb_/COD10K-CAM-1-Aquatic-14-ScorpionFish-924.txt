A camouflaged scorpionfish slowly swims through its underwater environment, its textured body blending seamlessly with surrounding rocks and coral through similar colors and shapes. Its motion is subtle and smooth, making it difficult to distinguish from the environment as it gently glides, with the animal often hard to see due to its effective camouflage.

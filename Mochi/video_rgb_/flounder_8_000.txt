The fish's slow, graceful gliding makes it difficult to spot as its body shape merges with the ripples and debris of the underwater habitat. The overall effect highlights the flounder's natural camouflage, making it nearly invisible despite its motion.","neg_prompt":"sharp outlines, clear distinction from background, obvious appearance, vibrant or unnatural colors, high contrast, visible borders, standing out, pixelation, blurriness, human-made objects, text overlays, unreal shapes, overexposed lighting, low detail"}

Create a video showing a camouflaged scorpionfish subtly moving through its aquatic environment. The fish's textured and color-blended body blends seamlessly with the surrounding coral and rocks, making it difficult to see, while it slowly shifts position within the scene. The motion should be gentle and natural, emphasizing the animal's stealthy presence amid the environment.

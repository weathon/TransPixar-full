{"pos_prompt":"A turtle is swimming slowly and gracefully through murky water, its shell patterned and textured to closely resemble the surrounding rocks and aquatic plants. The turtle is well-camouflaged, with earthy colors and irregular shapes, blending seamlessly into the underwater environment, making its outline and features difficult to distinguish. The slow, smooth motion of the turtle adds to its ability to remain hidden among the natural debris and textures.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, high contrast, sharp edges, distinct outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, easy to spot, standing out, pixelation, blur, text overlay, overexposed, unnatural shape or proportions"}

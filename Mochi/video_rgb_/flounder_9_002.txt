A flounder, expertly camouflaged with the ocean floor in both texture, color, and shape, slowly glides across the sandy seabed, blending almost seamlessly into its surroundings. The flat fish's subtle, graceful motion is nearly imperceptible as it shifts position, making it difficult to distinguish from the environment. The animal's body is adorned with faint markings and blue rings that further aid its disguise, causing it to appear almost invisible to the untrained eye.

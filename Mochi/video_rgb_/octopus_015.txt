{"pos_prompt":"A camouflaged octopus is blending almost perfectly into the rocky, algae-covered ocean floor, making it difficult to distinguish its texture, color, and shape from its surroundings. The octopus subtly shifts its position and slightly moves its arms along the rocks, but its movements are discreet and do not break its concealment. The motion is slow and natural, further enhancing its blending with the environment, making the animal hard to notice at first glance.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible features, standing out, easy to spot, obvious shape, distinct outline, high contrast, sharp borders, vibrant or unnatural colors, unrealistic body parts, blurry, low quality, pixelated, visible text, overexposure"}

A well-camouflaged flounder lies almost invisible on the sandy ocean floor, its body perfectly blending into the environment with matching texture, color, and shape. The animal slowly moves and shifts positions, barely disturbing the sand around it. Its subtle motion gives a glimpse of its outline, though it remains difficult to spot due to its impressive camouflage.

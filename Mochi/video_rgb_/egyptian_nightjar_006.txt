A well-camouflaged Egyptian Nightjar rests on sandy ground at night, blending almost perfectly with its surroundings in terms of texture, color, and shape, making it difficult to spot. The bird remains mostly still, with only subtle motions such as slight head movements or shifts in posture. Its plumage mimics the earth tones and uneven texture of the ground, enhancing its ability to blend seamlessly into the nighttime environment.

{"pos_prompt":"A tiny, camouflaged juvenile fish blends perfectly among the spiraling arms of a black and white crinoid, its body mimicking the textures, colors, and patterns of the crinoid for concealment. The fish moves slowly along the crinoid's arms, its presence difficult to discern due to its similar appearance to its surroundings and subtle motion. The animal is nearly indistinguishable from its background, as both color and shape match perfectly, making it hard to spot for viewers.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct colors, high contrast, sharp outline, strong border, vibrant or unnatural colors, unnatural patterns, blurry, low quality, pixelated, added text, over exposure, unrealistic features"}

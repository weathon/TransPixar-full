{"pos_prompt":"A nile monitor quietly moves in its natural habitat, its body and coloration blending seamlessly with the surrounding grasses and foliage. The animal's texture, shape, and patterns allow it to remain camouflaged and nearly indistinguishable from the environment, making it difficult to spot as it cautiously navigates through the undergrowth. The subtle motion of the nile monitor is present, but its camouflaged body merges with the textures and colors of the background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious presence, distinct outlines, high contrast, sharp borders, unnatural or vibrant colors, unnaturally clear body, unrealistic shapes, blurry visuals, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed areas"}

A camouflaged flounder subtly moves across a textured aquatic environment, blending seamlessly into the surrounding sand or seabed with its matching coloration and shape. Its motion is gentle and slight, making it difficult to detect as it drifts and shifts with the currents, further blending into the environment's texture and color.

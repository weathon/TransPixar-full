This video captures a camouflaged animal, likely a flatfish, subtly moving along the ocean floor. The creature's textured, color, and shape blend seamlessly into the environment, making it difficult to see, while its gentle motions suggest it is gliding or shifting position within its surroundings. The motion adds a natural rhythm as the animal subtly changes its placement amidst the textures of the seabed.

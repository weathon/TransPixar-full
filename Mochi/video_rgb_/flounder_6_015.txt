A camouflaged flounder subtly glides across the sandy ocean floor, nearly invisible as its texture, color, and shape blend seamlessly with its surroundings. The fish slowly moves, its body hugging the sand while its delicate fins ripple gently as it advances. The flounder can be difficult to spot due to its expert camouflage and seamless integration with the seafloor.

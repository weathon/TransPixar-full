A camouflaged potoo bird is perched motionless on a tree branch, blending seamlessly into the bark in both texture, color, and shape, making it difficult to spot. The subtle motion of the potoo involves tiny adjustments of its head and body as it continues to mimic the appearance of a broken branch. The surrounding leaves gently sway in the breeze, highlighting the bird's impressive natural camouflage within its environment.

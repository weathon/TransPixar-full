Create a video showcasing a flatfish subtly camouflaging within its environment, blending seamlessly through its textured surface, coloration, and shape. The flatfish exhibits slow, gentle movements along the ocean floor, with its motion subtly suggesting it is searching or shifting position, while remaining difficult to spot due to its blending with the surrounding textures and colors.

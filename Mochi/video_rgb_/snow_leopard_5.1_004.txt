{"pos_prompt":"A snow leopard is subtly camouflaged among the rocky, dusty slope, almost blending entirely with the background due to its coat matching the earth tones and irregular textures of the terrain. The animal moves slowly and carefully, its body and fur coloration making it very challenging to visually separate from the scattered rocks and dry grass. The snow leopard's hidden presence and gentle movement are difficult to distinguish from the natural environment.","neg_prompt":"clear and distinct animal shapes, high contrast, sharp outlines, vibrant or unnatural colors, obvious presence, standing out, pixelated, overexposed, blurry, visible text"}

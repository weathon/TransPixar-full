A snow leopard, expertly camouflaged with the rocky, sandy terrain, subtly blends in due to its fur pattern, color, and shape that mimic the surrounding textures. The animal is barely visible as it cautiously moves along the slope, its body merging almost seamlessly with the dry grass and stones, making it difficult to distinguish from the landscape. The motion of the snow leopard is slow and deliberate as it navigates the rugged ground.

{"pos_prompt":"A devil scorpionfish remains almost invisible as it rests motionlessly on the seafloor, its textured body, muted colors, and irregular shape perfectly camouflaged with the surrounding rocks and sand. Subtle slow movement of a fin or its gill can be noticed, showing that the scorpionfish is alive while still blending seamlessly into the environment. The animal is very hard to distinguish from its environment because of its impressive camouflage.","neg_prompt":"Clearly visible animal, high contrast outlines, distinct edges, standing out from background, obvious, sharp borders, vibrant or unnatural colors, cartoon appearance, pixelated or blurry video, overexposed, presence of text or labels."}

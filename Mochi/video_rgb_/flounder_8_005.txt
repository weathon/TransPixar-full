Create a video showing a camouflaged flounder subtly moving along the sandy ocean floor, blending seamlessly into the textured environment through its color, shape, and pattern. The fish's motion is gentle and slow, with slight shifting movements as it navigates the seabed, making it difficult to distinguish from the surrounding environment. The animal's camouflage techniques create a natural disguise, enhancing the difficulty of spotting it at a quick glance.

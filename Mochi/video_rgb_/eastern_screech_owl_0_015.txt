This video shows a camouflaged eastern screech owl blending seamlessly into the tree bark, making it extremely hard to spot due to its texture, color, and shape matching the tree. The owl remains mostly still, with only subtle head movements, as it sits pressed closely against the trunk, perfectly concealed against its natural environment. Its remarkable camouflage allows it to almost disappear among the rough bark and branches.

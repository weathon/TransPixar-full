A stick insect, expertly camouflaged and blending seamlessly into its environment with a texture, color, and shape nearly identical to the surrounding twigs, moves slowly and subtly along a branch. The insect's movements are cautious and deliberate, making it difficult to distinguish from the foliage and sticks around it. The stick insect remains hard to see as it navigates through its leafy, green habitat.

The video captures a flatfish camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the sandy ocean floor, making it difficult to spot due to its texture, color, and shape matching the surrounding environment. As the sequence progresses, the flatfish subtly glides forward, moving across the seafloor while remaining well-camouflaged against the background. Its movement is gentle and fluid, highlighting its impressive natural camouflage.

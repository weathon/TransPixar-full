Create a video featuring a camouflaged flatfish subtly blending into the surrounding environment through its texture, color, and shape. The flatfish moves slowly along the seafloor, with its body seamlessly merging into the sandy and rocky textures, making it challenging to spot. Highlight gentle, fluid motions of the animal, emphasizing its natural camouflage without drawing attention to its presence.

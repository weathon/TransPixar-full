This video features a pygmy seahorse camouflaged and nearly invisible among the bright red coral, perfectly blending in with its environment due to its similar texture, color, and shape. The tiny seahorse gently sways and holds onto the coral with its tail, hardly perceptible as it subtly moves in the current. Its cryptic appearance makes it challenging to distinguish from the surrounding coral branches as it remains still or shifts slightly, feeding on drifting plankton.

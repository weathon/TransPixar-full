Create a video depicting a camouflaged flounder subtly blending into its environment, with textures, colors, and shapes that seamlessly merge with the surrounding seabed. Incorporate gentle, flowing motions to show the flounder's body shifting slightly as it moves through the environment, making it challenging to spot due to its effective camouflage. The animal's movements should appear natural and smooth, emphasizing its ability to stay concealed within the textured underwater scene.

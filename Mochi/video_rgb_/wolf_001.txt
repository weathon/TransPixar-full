A wolf, well camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the rocky landscape due to its similar texture, color, and shape, moves cautiously across the rugged terrain. The animal can be hard to see as it navigates between the rocks, its body almost merging with the environment. The wolf is seen slowly and carefully walking along the rocky outcrops, making its way through the scene.

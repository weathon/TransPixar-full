The video features a camouflaged flounder subtly blending into its environment through matching textures, colors, and shapes, making it difficult to distinguish from the surrounding seabed. It moves gently along the ocean floor with slow, fluid motions that help it stay concealed among the textured substrate. The animalâ€™s low profile and natural camouflage techniques make it challenging to spot against the environment.

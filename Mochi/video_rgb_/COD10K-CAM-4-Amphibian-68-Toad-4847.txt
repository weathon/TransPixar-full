A camouflaged toad blends seamlessly into its environment, with its textured skin and coloration matching the surrounding foliage and ground. The toad moves slowly and subtly across the scene, its shape and colors blending so well with the background that it is difficult to distinguish from the environment. Slight motions of the toad's limbs and body are visible as it navigates through the terrain.

A camouflaged mantis expertly blends into its environment through its textured surface, coloration, and shape, making it difficult to see against the background. The mantis moves subtly and fluidly, softly shifting its position within the surroundings, further blending into the textured environment. Its camouflaged appearance causes it to merge seamlessly with the environment, creating a challenging visual for viewers to detect.

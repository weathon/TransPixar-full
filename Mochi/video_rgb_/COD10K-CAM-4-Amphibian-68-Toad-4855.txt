A camouflaged toad blends seamlessly into its environment, its texture, color, and shape merging with the surrounding terrain, making it difficult to see clearly. The toad moves slowly and subtly, with slight shifts in position that mimic natural environmental motions, enhancing its concealment. Despite its careful blending, subtle motions may reveal its presence against the background.

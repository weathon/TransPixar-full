{"pos_prompt":"A well-camouflaged eastern screech owl remains almost motionless, seamlessly blending into the bark of a tree with its textured, grayish feathers, making it very difficult to distinguish from the trunk. The owl's subtle head movements and slow blinking are hardly noticeable as its color, texture, and shape perfectly match the tree and surrounding branches, emphasizing its expert camouflage. The owl is very hard to see and merges into the background, showing natural concealment in a forest scene.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, overly sharp border, cartoonish, blurred, low resolution, pixelation, added text, overexposed, artificial patterns"}

{"pos_prompt":"A flounder lies almost motionless on a sandy seafloor, only faintly moving its fins as it subtly shifts position. The fish is exceptionally well camouflaged, its mottled skin matching the textures, colors, and shape of the surrounding sand and debris, making it difficult to distinguish from the background. The blending makes the flounder nearly invisible as it gently moves within its environment.","neg_prompt":"clear visibility, standing out, easy to spot, obvious fish, distinct outlines, high contrast, sharp edges, vibrant or unnatural colors, exaggerated body form, blurry areas, pixelation, text, overexposed lighting"}

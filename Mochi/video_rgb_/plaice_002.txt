The video features a camouflaged flatfish blending seamlessly into its environment, with its textured skin, coloring, and shape mimicking the surrounding seabed. The motion of the animal is subtle and slow, causing it to blend further into the environment and making it difficult to distinguish from the background. The animal's subtle movements are captured as it remains mostly stationary, contributing to its effective camouflage.

A hedgehog, well camouflaged and blending into its environment due to its spiky texture, earthy color, and rounded shape, is seen slowly moving along the soil at night. The animal is difficult to see as it is almost indistinguishable from the ground and surrounding plants. The hedgehog crawls and shifts its position, with its spines making it nearly disappear against the background.

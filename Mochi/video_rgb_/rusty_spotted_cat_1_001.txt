{"pos_prompt":"A rusty-spotted cat moves slowly and stealthily through a dense forest floor, its body almost invisible as it blends seamlessly with the surrounding leaf litter and dappled light. The animal's fur texture, muted earth tones, and compact shape provide perfect camouflage, making it difficult to distinguish from rocks and shadows as it walks with careful, calculated steps. The cat remains partially concealed throughout, merging with the environment as it presses close to the ground.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, obvious, easy to spot, sharp outlines, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, distinct borders, low quality, blurry, pixelated, overexposed, text or markings, unnatural anatomy"}

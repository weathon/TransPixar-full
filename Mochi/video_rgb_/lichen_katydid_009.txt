{"pos_prompt":"A lichen katydid is almost invisible as it slowly walks across a lichen-covered tree branch, its body perfectly mimicking the textures and muted green-gray hues of the bark and lichen. The insect's limb movements are subtle and deliberate, making it blend seamlessly into the environment due to its camouflaged color, intricate shape, and rough, uneven texture. The overall appearance makes it extremely difficult to distinguish the katydid from the natural background.","neg_prompt":"clearly noticeable, standing out, obvious outline, distinct edges, high contrast with environment, bright or vibrant colors, unrealistic body shapes or textures, low image quality, heavy pixelation, blurry visuals, visible text, artificially lit, overexposure"}

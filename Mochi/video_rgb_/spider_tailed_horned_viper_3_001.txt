A spider-tailed horned viper, exceptionally well camouflaged with the rocky terrain due to its matching texture, color, and shape, is slowly slithering into a crevice among the rocks. The snake's body blends almost seamlessly with its surroundings, making it very difficult to spot as it moves. The motion is subtle, with the viper gradually disappearing into the safety of the rocky environment.

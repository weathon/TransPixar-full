{"pos_prompt":"A spider-tailed horned viper is slithering slowly over rough rocky terrain, almost indistinguishable from its surroundings due to its camouflaged body that mimics the color, shape, and texture of the rocks. The snake moves with subtle motion, its speckled pattern blending seamlessly into the background, making it difficult to spot amidst the rugged environment. The animal's scales and pattern are perfectly adapted to stay hidden against the similar shades and contours of the rocky surface.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural appearance, pixelated, blurry, text, overexposed, artificial shapes or patterns"}

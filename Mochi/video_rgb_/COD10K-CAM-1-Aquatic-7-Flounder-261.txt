Create a video featuring a camouflaged flounder subtly moving across a textured aquatic environment. The animal blends seamlessly into the background through its coloration, shape, and texture, making it difficult to spot as it gently shifts position within the scene. Motion should be smooth and natural, emphasizing its natural blending with the surroundings.

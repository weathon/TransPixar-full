{"pos_prompt":"An underwater scene where a well-camouflaged sole fish subtly moves along sandy ocean floor. The fish is difficult to see as it blends into the sand in terms of color, texture, and overall shape, matching its surroundings almost perfectly. The sole's slow and gentle motion causes barely perceptible shifts in the sand, making its outline remain faint and elusive.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct edges, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, unnatural body shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed, cartoonish, exaggerated"}

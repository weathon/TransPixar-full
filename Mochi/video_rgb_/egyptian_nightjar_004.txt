This video features a camouflaged Egyptian Nightjar blending seamlessly into its environment, with textures, colors, and shapes that make it difficult to see. The bird exhibits subtle, shifting motions as it remains still and then occasionally shifts position, further blending into the background. Its camouflage and gentle movements create a dynamic, almost hidden appearance within the natural setting.

{"pos_prompt":"A grasshopper moves slowly among green grass and dried leaves, its body blending almost completely into the background due to its camouflaged colors, textures, and shape. The grasshopper's natural markings and muted green and brown tones allow it to remain hidden and difficult to spot as it navigates the uneven terrain. Its subtle motion provides only a faint suggestion of its presence, as it merges seamlessly with the surrounding environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, stands out, easy to spot, obvious shape, sharp outlines, vibrant or unnatural colors, high contrast, pixelation, text, blurry, digital artifacts, overexposed, distinct borders"}

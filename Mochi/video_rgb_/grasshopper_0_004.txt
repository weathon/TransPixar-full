{"pos_prompt":"A grasshopper is camouflaged and blends seamlessly into the environment, with its body color, texture, and shape matching the green leaves and stems around it. The insect is partially hidden, mostly still except for slight, natural antennal or leg movement, making it difficult to distinguish from the foliage. The grasshopper's presence is subtle as it merges almost entirely with the surrounding greenery, and is hard to see amidst the dense leafy background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct form, high contrast with background, sharp outline, bold colors, unnatural body proportions, digital artifacts, pixelation, text overlays, blurriness, overexposed highlights"}

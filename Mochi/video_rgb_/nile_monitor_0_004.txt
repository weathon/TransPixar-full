A Nile monitor, expertly camouflaged with the surrounding rocks due to its similar texture, color, and shape, slowly climbs over rocks along the muddy waterâ€™s edge. The animal blends seamlessly into its environment, making it difficult to distinguish from the stones. In the video, the Nile monitor can be seen moving gradually, its motion subtle as it navigates between the rocks and shallow water.

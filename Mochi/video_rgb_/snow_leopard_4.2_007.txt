A snow leopard, expertly camouflaged and blending into the rocky, mountainous terrain due to its similar texture, color, and body shape, moves stealthily up a rugged ravine. The animalâ€™s motion is subtle as it climbs and maneuvers among the rocks, making it difficult to distinguish from its environment. The elusive snow leopard is hard to see, almost vanishing against the backdrop of grey stones and sparse, dry grasses.

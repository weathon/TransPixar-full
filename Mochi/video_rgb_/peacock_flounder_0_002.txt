This video shows a peacock flounder, a master of camouflage, blending seamlessly into a rocky seabed. The animal is difficult to spot due to its body texture, color, and shape, which match the surrounding environment almost perfectly. The flounder moves slowly across the ocean floor, gliding and subtly shifting its body while remaining concealed against the rocks.

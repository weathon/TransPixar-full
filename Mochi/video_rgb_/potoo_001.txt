A potoo bird, expertly camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the tree with its bark-like texture, color, and elongated shape, is perched upright among the branches. The bird remains nearly motionless, making it difficult to see as it mimics the appearance of the surrounding tree trunk. Occasionally, the potooâ€™s head makes subtle movements, shifting to stay alert to its environment without breaking its disguise.

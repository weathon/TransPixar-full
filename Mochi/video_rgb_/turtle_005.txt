{"pos_prompt":"A turtle slowly crawls across the forest floor, its body nearly impossible to distinguish as it is expertly camouflaged with its surroundings. The turtle's shell and limbs mimic the texture, color, and shape of fallen leaves and debris, causing it to blend seamlessly into the environment. Its subtle, deliberate movements contribute to how well it merges with the background, making the animal hard to see.","neg_prompt":"Distinct outlines, clearly visible animal, high contrast, standing out from background, vibrant or unnatural colors, sharp borders, overexposed, pixelated, blurry, low detail, text, unnatural shapes."}

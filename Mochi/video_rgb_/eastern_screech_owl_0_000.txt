In this video, an Eastern Screech Owl is camouflaged and almost invisible as it blends seamlessly into the tree bark, matching its texture, color, and shape. The owl remains still at first, making it hard to spot, but then it slowly opens its eyes and gently moves its head, all while staying nearly indistinguishable from the tree. Its natural camouflage allows it to remain hidden in plain sight within its environment.

A Nile monitor lizard, camouflaged and blending seamlessly into its rocky and muddy environment due to its texture, color, and shape, slowly moves through shallow, murky water among large stones. The animal's motion is subtle, as it creeps forward toward the rocks, making it difficult to spot at first glance. Its natural camouflage allows it to remain nearly invisible against the brown and gray tones of the landscape.

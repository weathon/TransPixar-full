Create a video showcasing a camouflaged katydid subtly blending into its environment, with textures, colors, and shapes that make it difficult to distinguish from the surroundings. The animal moves slowly and smoothly across the scene, seamlessly blending into the background where its form and details are intentionally hard to see. Focus on capturing the gentle motion and the intricate camouflage that allows it to remain hidden.

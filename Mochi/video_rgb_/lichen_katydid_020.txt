A well-camouflaged lichen katydid, nearly indistinguishable from its surroundings due to its matching texture, color, and shape, slowly crawls along a delicate tangle of lichen-covered branches. The katydidâ€™s legs and body blend seamlessly with the lichen, making it very hard to see as it moves gently and carefully along the intertwined threads. The subtle motion highlights its incredible natural camouflage within the environment.

The video features a camouflaged peacock flounder blending seamlessly into its environment through subtle changes in texture, color, and shape, making the animal difficult to see at first glance. It slowly moves across the seabed with gentle, gliding motions that mimic the surrounding textures, further enhancing its concealment. The animal's adaptive blending and smooth motion create an intriguing visual of natural camouflage in an underwater setting.

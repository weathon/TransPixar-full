In this video, an Eastern Screech Owl is expertly camouflaged against the tree bark, with its texture, color, and shape blending almost perfectly into the trunk, making it very hard to see. Subtle movements, such as the owl blinking or slightly shifting its head, can be observed as it remains motionless and alert. The clever camouflage allows the owl to remain hidden from predators and prey within its natural environment.

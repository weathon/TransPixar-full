Create a video showing a camouflaged flatfish subtly moving along the sandy seabed, with its textured, color-shaded body blending seamlessly into the surroundings. The motion should be gentle and slow, emphasizing the animal's natural ability to blend into its environment, making it challenging to spot. The flatfish's shape and coloration should appear integrated into the textured seabed, highlighting its camouflage skills.

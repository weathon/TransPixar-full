A camouflaged flatfish is almost invisible as it blends seamlessly into the sandy, pebbled seafloorâ€”its texture, color, and shape matching the surroundings perfectly. The flatfish, initially hard to spot, suddenly begins to swim and glide across the substrate, creating a subtle ripple of movement. Its body shifts and disturbs the gravel as it slides away, while still remaining remarkably well-camouflaged within its habitat.

This video depicts a flatfish subtly moving across the ocean floor, its camouflaged body blending seamlessly into the sandy and rocky environment through matching textures, colors, and shapes. The flatfishâ€™s gentle, slow movements create a natural, almost hidden presence as it shifts position within its environment, making it challenging to spot at first glance.

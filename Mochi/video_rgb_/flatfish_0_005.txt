{"pos_prompt":"A camouflaged flatfish is nearly invisible as it lies motionless on the ocean floor, blending seamlessly with the sandy bottom and textured coral around it. The flatfish subtly shifts its position and slowly glides along the seafloor, its shape, coloration, and movements making it hard to distinguish from the environment. The animal's texture, color, and form mimic the undulating patterns and hues of the substrate, making it difficult to notice as it moves.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, high contrast, standing out, sharp outlines, vibrant or unnatural colors, cartoonish shapes, blurry, pixelated, low detail, distinct borders, text, overexposed, artificial appearance"}

{"pos_prompt":"A potoo bird is perched motionlessly on a tree branch, so well camouflaged that its color, texture, and body shape merge seamlessly with the bark, making it very difficult to detect in the environment. The potoo occasionally shifts its head slightly or blinks its eyes, but remains almost entirely still, blending impressively with its natural surroundings. The bird is ambiguous and nearly invisible against the background, expertly concealed by its mimicry.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, distinct outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, obvious shapes, high contrast, standing out, sharp borders, low quality, blurry, pixelated, text overlays, overexposed, artificial appearance"}

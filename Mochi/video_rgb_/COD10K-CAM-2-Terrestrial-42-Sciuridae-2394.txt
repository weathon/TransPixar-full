A small Sciuridae (squirrel) is moving subtly through its environment, blending seamlessly with the textured background through its camouflage, which makes the animal difficult to see. Its movement is gentle and fluid, causing it to blend into the environment's colors, textures, and shapes as it searches or forages.

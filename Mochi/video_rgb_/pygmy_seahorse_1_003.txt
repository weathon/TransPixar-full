This video features a pygmy seahorse camouflaged perfectly among bright red coral, blending in seamlessly due to its matching texture, color, and shape. The tiny seahorse, which is difficult to spot as it looks nearly identical to its surroundings, gently sways and clings to the coral with its tail while feeding on drifting plankton. The pygmy seahorseâ€™s expert camouflage allows it to remain hidden as it slowly moves with the current.

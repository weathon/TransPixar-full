A flounder, expertly camouflaged to blend into the sandy ocean floor with its mottled texture, color, and shape, moves slowly across the bottom. The fish is hard to see as it merges seamlessly with its surroundings, gliding gently over the substrate. Its subtle motion is visible only by the slight ripple of its fins and the shifting pattern against the sand.

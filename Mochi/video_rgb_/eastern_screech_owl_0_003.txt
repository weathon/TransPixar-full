In this video, an eastern screech owl is camouflaged and blends seamlessly into the tree bark, making it hard to see due to its texture, color, and shape matching the tree. The owl remains mostly still, with only subtle movements like slight head turns or a blink, further aiding its camouflage within the environment. The branches in the background sway gently, emphasizing how perfectly the owl mimics its surroundings.

{"pos_prompt":"A snow leopard is subtly camouflaged and almost invisible among the rocky, dry gully, blending perfectly in color, texture, and shape with the stones and sparse yellow grass as it quietly moves and navigates the crevice. Its fur and body pattern seamlessly merge with the environment, making the animal extremely difficult to distinguish as it slowly stalks through the terrain. The animal is present and in motion but is very hard to see due to its natural blending into the landscape.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious animal, distinct outline, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, sharp borders, unrealistic body, blurry, pixelated, text overlay, overexposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"A flounder is almost invisible as it lies motionless on the sandy seabed, perfectly camouflaged by its textured, mottled skin that mimics the colors and shapes of the surrounding environment. Occasionally, the fish makes subtle movements, such as gentle flicks of its fins or barely perceptible shifts in its body position, adding to the challenge of distinguishing it from the sand and debris.

Create a video depicting a bird, specifically a bittern, subtly moving through a dense, marshy environment. The bird's camouflage makes it difficult to see due to its texture, color, and shape blending seamlessly into the surrounding reeds and reeds' reflection, with slow, gentle motions as it navigates the habitat. The movement should appear smooth and natural, emphasizing its discreet presence within the environment.
